Clean the cost model of its existing data source and all the data collected and accumulated in the associated tables. Follow the steps to seamlessly change the data source.

## Steps to change the data source of a cost model

1.  Remove the following data from their respective tables:
    1.  The allocation breakdowns for the cost model from the Cost Allocation Breakdown Aggregate \[itfm\_allocation\_breakdown\] table.
    2.  The allocation for the cost model from Cost Allocation \[itfm\_allocation\] table.
    3.  The allocation aggregates for the cost model from the Cost Allocation Aggregate \[itfm\_allocation\_aggregate\] table.
    4.  The groomed records for the cost model from the Groomed General Ledger Data \[Itfm\_gl\_data\_groomed\] table.
    5.  The cleansed records for the cost model from the General Ledger Cleansed Data \[itfm\_gl\_data\_cleansed\] table.
    6.  The records from the Cost Allocation Runs Log \[itfm\_ca\_run\_log\] table for the cost model.
