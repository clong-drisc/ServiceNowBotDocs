# Financial Management example allocations - Legacy

The demo data that is available with the Financial Management application provides examples of cost allocations that you can use to model allocation rules, methods, and metrics.

## Allocate by number of servers

This weighted allocation metric allocates to servers based on the server cost.

-   **Metric name**: Servers by Server cost
-   **Type**: weighted

Notice the following field values:

-   **Weight table** is the Server table in the CMDB.
-   **Reference to allocate to** is the field on the weight table that you are allocating to. In this case, you are allocating to individual servers that are identified by their sys\_id.
-   **Aggregate** takes the value of the **Aggregate count** field in the weight table, which in this case is **Cost**.
-   **Aggregate count** is the cost of each server, which is identified on the server record.
