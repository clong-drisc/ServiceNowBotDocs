# Allocate expenses using service offering allocation map - Legacy

## About this task

Although the base system provides you with the default **Equal** method to roll up the expenses from the IT Shared Services segment to the Service Offering segment, you can also opt for **Weighted** rollup method. In this method, the expenses from the IT shared service segment are allocated to the service offering segment based on the consumption data that you have stored or entered in the Service Offering Allocation Map \[itfm\_service\_offering\_allocation\_map\] table. In this case, the expense is allocated based on the weightage of consumption. Therefore, cost is divided using **Allocate to Service Offering on Allocation Maps** metric and the Service Offering Allocation Map table that has the consumption data is used to weight the metric.
