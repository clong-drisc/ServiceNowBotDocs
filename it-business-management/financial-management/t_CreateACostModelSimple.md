# Clone a cost model in the workbench - Legacy

Use the preconfigured cost models or clone one from the base cost models for your financial model activities. By cloning you can map your financial data source to the cost model as per your business requirements without affecting the original cost model.

## Before you begin

Role required: cost\_transparency\_admin or cost\_transparency\_analyst

**Important:**

-   This feature is available only when you own an ITBM Analyst license.
-   If you are upgrading from a previous version to Yokohama, by default, the **Generate Controlled Cost Lines** option is enabled on the new model and the **Generate GL Expense Lines** option is disabled on the new model irrespective of whether the options were disabled or enabled in the base model. These options are not editable and do not appear on the default view of the Cost Model View page.

## About this task

You can select a preconfigured basic cost model or clone a cost model from the **Data Definition** stage of the **Workbench** or from the **Cost Models** tab.

    -   Click the **Cost Models** tab, select the base cost model, and click the **Clone Cost Model** button or the **Clone this cost model** \(![Clone this model icon](../image/ClonethisCostModel.png)\) **Action** icon.
