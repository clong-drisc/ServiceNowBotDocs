# Prescriptive cost models for shared services and business applications - Legacy

L1 Costing – Shared Services provides a complete visibility of fully loaded IT infrastructure cost, infrastructure shared services showback, and lays foundation for future growth. L2 Costing – Business Applications provides cost of applications and end user, aligns applications to business units, furnishes cost information to support each business unit in business terms.

**Important:**

This feature is available only when you own an ITBM Analyst license.

## L1 Costing – Shared Services

The specifications of the L1 Costing – Shared Services are:

![L1 Costing – Shared Services](../image/L1-CostModel.png "L1 Costing – Shared Services")

-   The cost bucket layer is tied to the ITFM bucket table \[itfm\_bucket\] and the cost buckets are specific to a model.
-   IT shared service segment accounts \(the middle layer in this model\) are sourced from the IT shared service table \[itfm\_shared\_service\].
-   The business unit layer is tied to the platform business unit table \[business\_unit\].

## L2 Costing – Business Applications

![L2 Costing – Business Applications](../image/L2-CostModel.png "L2 Costing – Business Applications")

The specifications of the L2 Costing – Business Applications are almost the same as L1 Costing – Shared Services. However, there is an additional layer for applications. Enterprise Architecture \(formerly APM\) Business Application \[cmdb\_ci\_business\_app\] table is the source of accounts to the applications segment. Or, it can be Application \[cmdb\_ci\_appl\] table or other custom tables.

## Seeded IT Shared Services

-   **IT Shared Service: Equip End Users**

    IT Shared Service: Equip End Users is a cost collection container that holds any money spent on providing the end users with personal \(not shared\) devices, the software that runs on these devices, and the support associated with making and keeping those devices functioning. This container excludes major device upgrades, lease cycle turnover, and other replenishment-related costs, which are captured within the Facilitate Ongoing Change container.

    IT Shared Service: Store and Manage Data is a cost collection container that holds any dollars spent on the underlying tools and foundational activities related to the management of structured and unstructured data \(for example, encryption, backups, purging, archiving, migrations, and DR replication\) and/or storage capacity \(for example, reorganizations and excess capacity acquisition\). It includes these types of activities and all the people power used to ensure the health of the data and storage landscape. This container excludes elements related to local storage on end user devices utilized by single individuals and specific activities, and allocated storage that can be related to specific applications or systems.

-   **IT Shared Service: Supply Computing Power**

    IT Shared Service: Supply Computing Power is a cost collection container that holds any dollars spent on providing foundational elements that exist, cost money to maintain, but may never actually be used such as disaster recovery facilities or contracts, hardware spares inventory, on-premises UPS systems, and generators. It also includes daily active data center costs related to things such as space, power, and cooling.


## ITFM prescribed metrics

-   **Allocate to Business Unit based on Change Request volume based on CIs**

    The metric allocates shared service cost to business unit based on the following weighting table:

    ![Allocate to Business Unit based on Change Request volume based on CIs](../image/PrescribedMetric1.png "Allocate to Business Unit based on Change Request volume based on CIs")

    -   The Change Request \[change\_request\] table provides a list of all change requests and their related configuration item.
