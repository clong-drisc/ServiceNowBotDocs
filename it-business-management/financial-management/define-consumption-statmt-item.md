# Define a consumption statement item

If your cost and business service usage details are sourced from an external consumption table, then you can source the consumption details of the consumption table for the statement item.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_charging\_analyst

**Important:**

This feature is available only when you own an ITBM Analyst license.

## About this task

Business service consumption details can come from a table belonging to one or other platform applications or from an external consumption table, in which case the consumption details can be loaded on to the platform table. The consumption table gives you the daily or monthly consumption details of a business service. Based on the usage, the cost of the service is computed using the unit cost and quantity consumed for a fiscal period.

For example, the monthly utility bill for household power consumption has details of the appliances that you run and the power consumed in Watts, calculated monthly and annually. Based on the unit price and the consumption quantity, the bill amount is generated.
