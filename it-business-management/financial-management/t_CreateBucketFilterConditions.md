# Create bucket filter conditions - Legacy

You can also create a condition to filter the data that goes into the bucket. These bucket filter conditions are also called grooming conditions, and they are the **Advanced query conditions** type.

## Before you begin

Role required: cost\_transparency\_admin or cost\_transparency\_analyst

## Procedure

1.  Click the filter icon in the bucket.

2.  Fill in the form fields \(see table\).

3.  Click **Submit**.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Name|Descriptive name for the condition.|
    |Priority|Value that determines when the filter is applied relative to other filters. If two filters have the same settings, the filter with a higher priority is applied.|
    |Table|The table containing the expenses that are filtered when put into the bucket. By default, the General Ledger Cleansed Data \[itfm\_gl\_data\_cleansed\] table is selected.|
    |Advanced bucketing condition|Use the condition builder to create the filter.|

    When you create a bucket filter, it appears in the **Advanced Conditions** tab above the donut chart in the right pane.

-   Click the amount to open the list of general ledger expenses that match the filter.

The advanced filter condition icon also appears on the bucket:
