# Create weighted allocation metrics - Legacy

You can create weighted metrics using an enhanced form or a standard form.

## Before you begin

Role required: cost\_transparency\_admin

## About this task

The enhanced form provides a visualization that helps you understand the relationships between the various components of the metric. Use the enhanced form that opens by default.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Financial Modeling** &gt; **Consumption Metrics** &gt; **Create Weighted Metric**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    A graphical representation of the weighted allocation appears in the **Metric Visualization** section. When you make changes to the form the graphic updates dynamically.

    **Note:** You cannot delete a rule that is referenced by a locked allocation line.

    **Enforce allocation from total weight** is an allocation metric based on capacity. As an IT financial analyst, you can also allocate cost where the total capacity of a service is greater than the sum of what is consumed. To enable this option, you must select the **Enforce allocation from total weight** check box in the **Total weight table** section. Select a total weight table to calculate the total weight of metric based on the total consumption capacity. The weighted metric allocates cost based on the total number of available units of consumption.

    **Note:** You can either enforce allocation relationship or enforce allocation from total weight. Enforce total weight if the total allocation is greater than the sum of the consumed values. Whereas, enforce allocation relationship works when the sum of all consumption values \(of all individual entities\) in the weight table adds up to a total capacity of 100%. For more information, see [Total weight support for allocations using weighted metric](../concept/c_RollupsForAllocations.md#total-weight-support-allocation).

    **Intermediary Segment** option: Use this option when you have a segment with large number of accounts that add to numerous allocation lines. Nevertheless, the intermediary segment is still considered for the amount to rollup through it for proper allocation. However, the segment identified as intermediary is not included in the hierarchy of cost model and its allocation lines are not generated.

    The option to identify a segment as an intermediary segment is just to exclude the segment in the generation of multiple cost lines. However, you should create a metric based on the relationship between the intermediary segment and the **Allocate to** segment to include the segment for accurate amount rollup. Based on the relationship the allocation engine creates the weight, and based on the weight the allocation lines are generated for the intermediary segment.

    You must create a cost allocation metric to process the weight of the intermediary segment that is referenced in the weight table. Two sets of weight maps are generated, one for the intermediary segment and another for the Allocate to segment.

3.  Click **Submit**.
