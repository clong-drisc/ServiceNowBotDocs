# Financial Management Level 2 Costing – Business Applications dashboard - Legacy

The Level 2 Costing – Business Applications dashboard provides an executive view into the total expenses on business applications consolidated for a quarter and year-to-date.

**Important:**

This feature is available only when you own an ITBM Analyst license.

The dashboard provides visibility on the application cost to an extent that you can drill the data on top spenders down to the buckets that contribute to the application cost, and business units that use the applications.

The dashboard is based on the Level 2 Costing – Business Applications cost model. This cost model aligns business applications to business units and hence you can know the cost of applications that support each business unit.
