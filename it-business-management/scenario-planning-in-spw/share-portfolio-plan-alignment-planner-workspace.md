# Share a portfolio plan with stakeholders

Share your portfolio plan with stakeholders and other planning managers so that they have visibility into the plan's progress and start collaborating.

## Before you begin

-   [Create a portfolio plan in Strategic Planning](create-portfolio-plans-in-alignment-planner-workspace.md).
-   Users or groups that you want to share the portfolio plan with must have the sn\_align\_core.ap\_read\_only or sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role to get the read or edit access to the portfolio plan respectively.

Role required: sn\_align\_core.apw\_user or business\_stakeholder

## About this task

Select individual users or groups to share the portfolio with.

When you share a portfolio plan with an individual user or a group, they can access the following data of the portfolio plan:

-   Planning page \(Prioritization and Roadmap tabs\) by default
-   Capacity tab in the Planning page if the user has the sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_user or sn\_align\_ws.spw\_capacity\_read role
-   Goals page if the user has the sn\_apw\_advanced.spw\_goal\_user role.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Strategic Planning Workspace** &gt; **Portfolio Planning**.

2.  From the list of portfolio plans, select one.

3.  From the portfolio plan header in the Planning page, select the **Share portfolio plan** icon \(![Share portfolio plan with users and groups](../images/icon-share-pp.png)\).

4.  On the Share portfolio plan form, select users to share the portfolio plan with and set their access appropriately.

    1.  In the **Members or Groups** field, enter the names of individual users or groups.

    2.  From the **Access** field, select the access level as **Viewer** or **Editor** for the selected names.

        -   An editor can view and change the portfolio plan's settings and data.
        -   A viewer can comment and add attachments to the portfolio plan, but cannot modify the portfolio plan's settings or data.

            **Note:** Even if a user has the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role, they cannot edit planning item data from the portfolio plan grid view or side panel when granted view-only access. However, users with the sn\_align\_core.apw\_user role can edit planning items and related tables from the record page.

5.  Select **Send invite**.


## Result

The selected individual and group users are notified of the portfolio plan sharing through an email.

## What to do next
