|-5|Pending|Pending|
|1|Open|Open|
|2|Work in Progress|Work in Progress|
|3|Closed Complete|Closed|
|4|Closed Incomplete|Closed|
|7|Closed Skipped|Closed|

The category information for the states is declared in [dictionary override](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DictionaryOverrides&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US) of State column in Planned task \(`planned_task`\) table in **Attributes** field. Planned task is the parent table for project and project task tables.

-   Pending/Open: Planned start date is displayed.
