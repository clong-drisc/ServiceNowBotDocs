# Manage operational resource plans from the allocation workbench

Create and manage operational resource plans effectively from one place using the Resource Allocation Workbench without having to navigate individually to the operational resource plan's form or list.

## About this task

**Important:** Allocation workbench is being deprecated starting Xanadu release. It will be hidden and no longer available for installation but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Resource Managers are encouraged to use the [Resource Management Workspace](../../resource-management-workspace/concept/rsrc-mgmt-wrkspc.md) to allocate, approve, and manage resource assignments. Resource Management Workspace is a dedicated workspace view for Resource Managers where you get the insights about unassigned tasks, heatmap view of resource bandwidth, custom view to handle priority resource assignment requests, and so on.

## Before you begin

Enable the **Create and manage operational resource plans from the resource allocation workbench** property by navigating to **All** &gt; **Project Administration** &gt; **Properties - Resource** to create operational resource plans from the Allocation Workbench. For more information, see [Resource Management properties](../reference/r_ResourceProperties.md).

Role required: resource\_manager

## Procedure

3.  Select the **Configuration** icon \(![Configuration](../image/configurationiconraw.png)\), and select **Operational plans**.
