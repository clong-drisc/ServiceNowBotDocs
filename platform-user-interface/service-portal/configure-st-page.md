# Configure the standard ticket page

Give Service Portal users a consistent way to view their submitted requests. You can configure the standard ticket page for different request types.

## Before you begin

## About this task

You can add a standard ticket configuration only for a task-extended table.

Widgets containing **Date/Time** values display the date and time only in the **Time Ago** \(for example, 11 minutes ago\) format, and user preferences for such widgets are not considered. For example, the **Created date** and the **Updated date** values are always displayed in the **Time Ago** format.
