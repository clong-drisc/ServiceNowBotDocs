# Activate the Knowledge Article View page on upgrade

If upgrading from a previous release, take advantage of the latest article view features by activating the **Knowledge Article View** page route map. New capabilities include article versioning and using links and images in article feedback. This map is active by default in new instances and applies to all portals in the system.
