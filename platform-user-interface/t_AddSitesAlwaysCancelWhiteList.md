# Add sites to the always cancel list

You can add UI pages or other links to the always cancel list so that users can cancel actions on these pages by navigating to another module or link.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

User actions can always cancel items on the list. You should only add items to the list that provide read-only data to the user, such as a dashboard or a report.

## Procedure

1.  Enter `sys_properties.list` in the navigation filter and press the Enter key.

2.  In the **Go to** field, select **Name**, enter `glide.request_manager.always_cancel`, and click **Go**.

3.  Click the property name to open it.

4.  In the **Value** field, add a comma-separated list of URIs you want to allow users to cancel.
