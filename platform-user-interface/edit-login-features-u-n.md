# Edit login theming in Next Experience

Customize Next Experience login illustrations and welcome text to provide a login experience that reflects your branding.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

This procedure is specific to login pages and does not apply if you are using Single Sign-On \(SSO\).

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator field, enter `sys_properties.list`.

2.  Prevent the login screen from showing any illustrations by setting the property **glide.ui.polaris.login.show\_illustrations** to **false**.

3.  Show welcome text by set the property **glide.ui.polaris.login.show\_welcome** to **true**.

    If this property doesn't exist, add it as a true/false property. For more information, see [Add a system property](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_AvailableSystemProperties&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&section=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&ft:locale=en-US).

4.  Edit the welcome page text.

    1.  Navigate to **System UI** &gt; **Welcome Page Content**.

    2.  Add a property that contains the login content you want to display.

        For the syntax of the isLoggedIn\(\) condition, see [GlideSession - Global](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_GlideSessionAPI&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-api-reference&ft:locale=en-US).
