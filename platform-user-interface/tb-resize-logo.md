# Resize a logo for your login screen

After you have uploaded a logo for your login screen, you can resize the logo by creating and setting a system property.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the Navigation filter, enter `sys_properties.list` and press **Enter**.

    The entire list of properties in the System Properties \[sys\_properties\] table appears.

2.  [Add a system property](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_AvailableSystemProperties&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&section=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&ft:locale=en-US) called glide.ui.polaris.login.logo.height.

3.  Set the system property **Value** to the maximum CSS height value for your logo.

    For example, any of the following would be valid entries:

    -   150px
    -   6em
    -   75%
    -   auto
    If you select **auto**, the browser calculates a height for the specified element.

    **Note:** An entry of 100% returns the logo to its original size.

4.  Save the system property.

    At the next launch, your logo is resized based on how you configured the system property.
