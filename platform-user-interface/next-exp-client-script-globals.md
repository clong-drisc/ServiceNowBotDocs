# Next Experience client-side scripting global variables

Next Experience global variables are used in client scripts to determine whether Next Experience is applied to a page.

-   **NOW.isUsingPolaris**

    Returns **true** if Next Experience is applied to the current page.

-   **NOW.isPolarisWrapper**

    Returns **true** if the page is running in the Next Experience Unified Navigation. This global variable exists only in the Unified Navigation.

    For more information about the Unified Navigation, see [Using the Next Experience Unified Navigation](../../../get-started/servicenow-overview/concept/using-the-next-experience-global-header.md).


Client script:

```
// Reload the current page in the unified navigator if not currently in the unified nav
if (NOW.isUsingPolaris && (!top.NOW || top.NOW.isPolarisWrapper !== "true")) {
    var currentPath = window.location.pathname + window.location.search;
    top.window.location.href = "/now/nav/ui/classic/params/target/" + encodeURIComponent(currentPath)
}

```
