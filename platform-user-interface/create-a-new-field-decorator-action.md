# Create a field decorator action

Add a field decorator to your configurable workspace.

## Before you begin

**Important:** This procedure explains how to add a field decorator action button to your configurable workspace. For instructions on how to configure your action button to open a custom modal, see [Configuring an action button to open a custom modal](configuring-an-action-button-to-open-a-custom-modal.md).

Role required: admin

**Note:** Field decorators can only be configured for single-line string fields. Multi-line fields do not support field decorators.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Declarative Actions** &gt; **Create new action**.

2.  Select **Field decorator** on the pop-up page.

3.  Enter an action label and other relevant configuration requirements.

    The action name populates automatically with the action label in all lowercase and with spaces replaced with underscores.

4.  Select a value for the **Implemented as** field.

    -   Create a server script or client script by selecting **server or client script** in the **Implemented as** field.
    -   Create a UXF client action by selecting **UXF client action** in the **Implemented as** field.

        For configuration instructions, see [Create a new UXF client action](create-a-new-uxf-client-action-for-forms.md).

5.  Select the menu icon \(![menu icon](../../workspace/image/menu-icon-save.png)\) and **Save**.
