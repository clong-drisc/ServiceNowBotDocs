# Getting work from chats

Use the agent inbox to manage your incoming work items, such as chats, cases, incidents, and more.

To open the agent inbox, select the Inbox ![Inbox icon in the Navigation panel](../image/inbox-icon-pol.png) icon in the navigation bar. When you accept a chat, an interaction record is automatically created and captures the work done in that session.

Accept a chat from your inbox. You have a time limit to accept a chat before it reroutes to another agent. The chat associates to an [interaction record](interaction-message-agent-workspace.md) that captures the conversation and work done during the session.During a chat session, you can:

-   Add attachments using the Action toolbar.
-   Transfer the chat to another agent.
-   Add another agent to the chat.
-   Perform other support tasks, such as create an incident or case.
-   Use workspace tools, such as the ribbon to glance at information or the activity stream to review related work.

-   Cross-channel conversation history: messages from all channels \(including Facebook Messenger, LINE, Slack, Twilio SMS, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, and Voice\) will appear.
