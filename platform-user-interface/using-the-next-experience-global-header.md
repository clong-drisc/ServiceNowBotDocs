# Using the Next Experience Unified Navigation

Improved navigation to access records and data, check your notifications, and set your preferences in the Next Experience Unified Navigation.

The Next Experience Unified Navigation runs across the top of every page and includes controls that help you in navigating your instance. Easily access your workspaces and classic environment, search your instance, and receive notifications.

Select the pin icon \(![Pin icon.](../image/pol-nav-pin.png)\) to pin a menu to the page.

**Note:** The Unified Navigation items described in the following table might not be available to all users. The items that appear are determined by user access and administrator customizations.
