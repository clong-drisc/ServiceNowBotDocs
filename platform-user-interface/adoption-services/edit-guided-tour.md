# Edit a guided tour

You can modify the settings of a guided tour, such as the roles that access the tour. You can also edit, add, delete, and reorganize the guided tour steps, and apply additional formatting to the instructional text.

## Before you begin

Role required: guided\_tour\_admin or admin

## About this task

Use the Guided Tour Designer \(GTD\) to add, delete, and reorganize guided tour steps. Use the Guided Tour form only to perform tasks you cannot do easily from the GTD. For demonstration purposes, we begin with edits to the form that appears when you open the guided tour record, and continue with edits you can make in the GTD itself. You can invoke the GTD from the **Edit with Designer** button located in the form.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Guided Tour Designer** &gt; **Guided Tours**.

2.  Open the guided tour you want to edit from the list.

3.  In the Guided Tour form, take any of the following actions.

    -   Edit the name.
    -   Enter a different page name in the **Context** field. For example, if the form page is listed and you want the user to start on the list view to enter a new record.
    -   Choose a different tour type. If the tour type is **Standard UI**, the **Type** field cannot be changed. If the tour type is **Service Portal**, both the **SP Portal** and **SP Page** values can be changed.
    -   Enter or edit the **Description**.
    -   Start a Service Portal tour from a specific widget, record, or view within a page instead of the page itself. You can enter URL parameters that point to the item in the Add Additional URL Parameters field. For example, enter the section of the URL that contains the sys-id of a widget, or type parameters for a specific record or view, such as `sys_id=abc123&view=myView`.
    -   Clear the **Active** check box to disable the guided tour, which sets it to read-only status, where it cannot be edited, and renders it invisible to end users. If you want to use the tour in the future but keep it unavailable to end users, consider setting it back to draft status for further revision. Select the check box to re-enable the tour.
4.  To view the starting page for the tour while you test and refine its steps, click **Edit with Designer** in the form header.

    The starting page opens in the GTD in a new tab or window.

5.  Having exited the form view, you can perform any of the following steps in the GTD.
