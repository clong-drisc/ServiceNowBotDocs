# Guided Tour Designer interface

The Guided Tour Designer \(GTD\) is a simplified way to create a guided tour. You can drag a callout to the element, and enter the step instructions and trigger in one step. You can test the steps as you build them, and modify them as needed.

The GTD has the following features:

![GTD interface with description callouts](../image/gtd-interface.png "GTD interface")

-   **Guided tour actions \(A\)**

    The icons on the upper right are used to copy a link to the tour so you can share it with another user, such as a tester.

-   **Callouts \(B\)**

    When you build a tour, drag and drop the callout at the desired position on the page element. The callout pointer must touch the element you are assigning it to.

    **Note:** Guided tours callouts don't work on user interface elements made on seismic. The AI Search feature utilizes Seismic technology.

-   **Steps \(C\)**

    When you hover over a step, it appears in the current view. If the step belongs to a previous page, then the **Not found in current view** message appears. In this example, the first step does not appear in current view. To change this step, you can click the back arrow on the upper left and open the list view where the step appears.

    **Note:** Do not put more than one interaction with a field in a step. Each step should describe or provide an interaction with just one field or other object.

-   **Step interaction \(D\)**

    As pictured, when you point to a step, its corresponding number in the page is enlarged. Click the step to edit the text or change the trigger. Drag it to a different position as needed. Click the \(-\) icon to delete it.

    If you make a mistake with a step, such as pointing it to the wrong element, you must delete it. Then you can add a new step with the correct information and drag it into place.

-   **Tour action buttons \(E\)**

    Click **Exit** to close the GTD. The browser tab or window closes and changes you made are automatically saved.

    Click **Play** to open the instance and designated UI page in a new browser tab or window and proceed through the steps. When you finish, close the tab or window to return to the GTD.
