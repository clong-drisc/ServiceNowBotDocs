# Create a trigger definition

Define the type of trigger that determines when to start running your playbook.

## Before you begin

-   Make sure to set your current application to the application that you want your playbook to run in. For more information, see [Application picker](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ApplicationPicker&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-application-development&ft:locale=en-US).
-   Role required: admin, playbook.admin, or pd\_trigger\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Process Automation Administration** &gt; **Trigger Definitions**.

2.  In the context header, click **New**.

3.  On the Trigger Definition form, in the **Label** field, enter any label for your trigger definition.

    This label appears as a trigger option when you [Create a playbook](create-process-definition.md).

4.  Next to the **Trigger Type** field, click the lookup using list icon \(![Lookup using list icon](../../flow-designer/images/lookup-using-list-icon.png)\).

5.  In the Trigger Types list, select a trigger type to use for your trigger definition.

    Options include:

    -   **Record Created**

        The playbook runs when a user creates a record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    -   **Record Updated**

        The playbook runs when a user updates an existing record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    -   **Record Created or Updated**

        The playbook runs when a user creates a record or updates an existing record anywhere in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    **Note:** Triggers only fire for record operations that are interactive, or made by users. Triggers don't fire for non-interactive record operations. For more information, see [Non-interactive sessions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_NonInteractiveSessions&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US).

6.  Click **Next** to go on to the next step.

7.  In the Table list, select a table whose record operations you want to trigger your playbook.

8.  Under Condition, use the [condition builder](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ConditionBuilder&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-user-interface&ft:locale=en-US) to add field conditions for when you want to trigger your playbook.

9.  To trigger your playbook for tables that extend your selected table, select the **Run On Extended** check box.

    For more information, see [Table extension and classes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=table-extension-and-classes&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US).

10. Click **Update** to finish creating your trigger definition.


## Result

Your trigger definition is added to the Trigger Definition \[sys\_pd\_trigger\_definition\] table. You can now select your preset trigger when you [Create a playbook](create-process-definition.md).
