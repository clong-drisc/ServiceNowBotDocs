# Load data structure

Load a data structure of child variables within an Object variable.

## Before you begin

-   Role required: action\_designer, flow\_designer, or admin
-   [Set up an application in Guided Application Creator](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=set-up-app&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-application-development&ft:locale=en-US) to store Workflow Studio content.
-   [Create an action in Workflow Studio](create-action.md) or [Create a subflow in Workflow Studio](create-subflow.md)

## Procedure

1.  Create a data variable.

2.  From **Type**, select **Object**.

3.  Expand the Advanced options for the Object variable whose data structure you want to replace.

4.  From **Structure**, select **Start from Template**.

    Workflow Studio displays the **Template** field.

5.  From **Template**, select the template containing the template you want to load.

    If the Object variable has no existing data structure, Workflow Studio loads the data structure into it. If the Object variable has an existing data structure, Workflow Studio displays a confirmation dialog to replace the existing structure.
