# Playbooks roles

Grant users one or more Playbooks roles to enable them to create triggers, playbooks, and activity definitions.

## Roles

To learn more about managing per-user subscriptions, see [Managing per-user subscriptions in Subscription Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-user-subscriptions-v2&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US) and contact your account representative.

System administrators can grant users access to Playbooks by assigning [delegated development permissions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_DelegatedDevelopment&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-application-development&ft:locale=en-US) or directly assigning [Roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-user-administration&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US). The following user roles are available for Playbooks:

</table>**Note:** Granting users Playbooks roles does not automatically allow them to access the Workflow Studio design environment. Granting users access to Workflow Studio may be helpful when creating activity definitions.
