-   **[Flow administration](flow-administration.md)**  
Identify and troubleshoot potential issues by reviewing action and flow executions, their result state, and their runtime duration.
-   **[User access to Workflow Studio flows](user-access-flow-designer.md)**  
Administrators can grant users access to Workflow Studio flows by assigning delegated development permissions or directly assigning a user role. Administrators can also specify which features and content a user can access based on user roles. Application developers can access Workflow Studio functionality through APIs for flows, subflows, and actions.
-   **[API access to Workflow Studio flows](api-access-flow-designer.md)**  
Application developers can access Workflow Studio functionality through APIs for flows, subflows, and actions. Flow authors can enable individual flows, subflows, and actions to be client callable during design.
-   **[Restricted caller access to Workflow Studio flows](restricted-caller-access-flow-designer.md#)**  
Track flows and actions that require access to cross-scope resources. Allow or deny flows and actions access to cross-scope resources.
-   **[Set flow user preferences](../task/set-flow-user-preferences.md)**  
Set your preferences when building and editing flows such as the default editor view.
-   **[Update to the latest version of Flow Diagramming](../task/update-to-latest-version-flow-diagramming.md)**  
Flow diagramming is automatically installed on your instance as a dependency of Workflow Studio.
