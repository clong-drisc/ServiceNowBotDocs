# Establish an SAP connection

After you have deployed the Advanced Business Application Programming \(ABAP\) program in your SAP system, create a connection profile to establish a connection between your SAP system and your ServiceNow instance.

## Before you begin

Before establishing a connection between SAP and your ServiceNow instance, check if your SAP system network is accessible to external applications like ServiceNow. If external connections are blocked, you can install a MID Server. A MID Server enables communication and data movement between a ServiceNow instance and external applications or data sources. For instructions, see [Installing the MID Server](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-server-installation&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-servicenow-platform&ft:locale=en-US).

If you already have a MID Server installed in the network and connected to your ServiceNow instance, this SAP connection will automatically use it.

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **SAP Compliance and Optimization** &gt; **Connection Setup** and select **New**.

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

</td><td>

Web Service Description Language \(WSDL\) URL from the SOA manager, that includes an IP address, that is used to connect to the SAP system.**Note:** Do not change the SAP WSDL name. The WSDL service definition name must be /NOW/SAMP and the service binding name must be NOW\_SAMP. The only WSDL name that can be changed is the WSDL generation name.

</table>3.  Select **Submit**.

    The initial connection is established.

4.  Select the SAP connection and review the fields on the record.

<table id="table_vzk_fwb_qfb"><thead><tr><th>

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Name of the connection profile. The value is generated in the SAP Connection Setup form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Default price list

</td><td>

Default price list that should be considered for reconciliation. The value is generated in the SAP Connection Setup form.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Use USMM Role Optimization

</td><td>

Check box to specify USMM role based optimization that must be applied during reconciliation.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Last run

</td><td>

Date and time that data was last pulled for the SAP connection.

</td></tr><tr><td>

SOAP message

</td><td>

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

User Mapping

</td></tr><tr><td>

SAP user field

</td><td>

SAP users across different clients that are mapped to a corresponding ServiceNow user.

</td></tr><tr><td>

User field

</td><td>

ServiceNow user field.**Note:** Changing the values in the User Mapping fields after data is pulled causes the mapping between discovered users and system users to be lost. The mapping between discovered users and the **Rights used by** and **Rights needed by** fields is also lost.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>5.  In the SAP Credentials related list, view the credentials you used to create the connection.

    **Note:** Only one credential record should be active for a given SAP connection. To determine the roles associated with your credentials, contact your SAP Basis administrator. Your administrator assigns respective roles to your SAP user ID credentials.

6.  To test your SAP connection and if you're running the latest version of the ABAP program, select the **Test SAP Connection and Version** related link.

    **Note:** If you upgrade your ServiceNow instance, you must download and deploy the new version of the ABAP program and reconfigure a service provider with the SOA Manager.

7.  To send a request to the custom ABAP program to collect the SAP data into the custom tables again, select the **Refresh data in SAP** related link.

8.  If the SAP data you pulled is corrupted and you need to see current data, select the **Pull all SAP Data to ServiceNow** related link.

    SAP data is scheduled to be pulled regularly.

9.  View SAP clients in the **SAP Clients** related list.

    The SAP clients are generated when SAP data is pulled during the scheduled job.

10. Select **Update**.
