# Reclaiming user subscriptions

You can reclaim unused SaaS and SSO subscriptions to reduce your total software costs.

The process of reclaiming a user subscription is similar to reclaiming a software license in ServiceNow® Software Asset Management. You can reclaim user subscriptions in both the Software Asset Management Core UI and the Software Asset Workspace.

When you’re reclaiming a user subscription, you can determine the status of the associated removal candidate using the following removal candidate states.

<table id="table_xrr_gfs_dbb"><thead><tr><th>

State

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Attention Required

</td><td>

The removal candidate requires attention.The state is set to **Attention Required** when the **User** field is empty on an automatic removal candidate that has the **Notify User** option enabled. After the **User** field is populated, the state automatically changes to **Ready**.

 The state can also be set to **Attention Required** when a reclamation fails. After you resolve the error, the state automatically changes to **Ready**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Ready

</td><td>

The removal candidate is ready for reclamation. Select **Reclaim** to advance the reclamation workflow.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Awaiting User

</td><td>

The user has been sent an email notification to approve or deny the removal request. This state is applicable only if the **Notify User** option is enabled on the removal candidate.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Awaiting Approval

</td><td>

The user must approve or deny the removal request. If the user wants to keep the subscription, the manager then becomes responsible for approving or declining the removal. This state is applicable only if the **Notify User** option is enabled on the removal candidate.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Awaiting Revocation

</td><td>

The removal candidate is awaiting reclamation.You can manually reclaim the user subscription in the removal candidate by selecting **Close Complete**. Alternatively, you can reclaim the user subscription through the **SAM — Updating Existing Reclamation Candidates** weekly scheduled job. When the scheduled job runs, removal candidates that are in the **Awaiting Revocation** state and have an empty **User subscription** field are automatically updated to the **Closed Complete** state.

 If the **User subscription** field is empty for a removal candidate that is in any other state, the reclamation workflow is canceled and the state automatically changes to **Closed Skipped**.

 The state of a removal candidate with restricted software is automatically set to **Awaiting Revocation**. The justification is set to **Restricted Software**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Complete

</td><td>

The user subscription has been reclaimed.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Skipped

</td><td>

The user subscription hasn’t been reclaimed by the removal candidate.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Closed Canceled

</td><td>

The user subscription hasn’t been reclaimed by the removal candidate because user activity is detected.

</table>**Warning:** Make sure that users don't lose access to their files when their account is reclaimed. Users can't stop their account from being reclaimed unless the **Notify user** check box is selected on the reclamation rule.

-   Reclaiming an Adobe Cloud subscription removes the user's access to the application and the files that they have created.
-   Reclaiming an Adobe Workfront account removes the user's access to your Workfront application. The user is no longer allowed to sign in.
-   Reclaiming an Aha! account deactivates the account so that you can't log in to the Aha! portal.
-   Reclaiming an Asana account deletes the user account. The user can no longer access the Asana projects or workspaces. Content that was created by the user remains accessible to other users and the Admin can reassign the tasks from the Asana dashboard.
-   Reclaiming a Box account deletes the account. All the files are moved into a folder in the Box admin account that authenticated the integration.
-   Reclaiming a Calendly account removes the account from your organization.
-   Reclaiming a Cisco Webex subscription removes the user's access to the specific product. The user can still access all other Cisco Webex products and the free licenses assigned.

-   Reclaiming a Dropbox account deletes the account. All the files are moved into a folder in the Dropbox admin account that authenticated the integration. The name of the created folder is the deleted user's email address.
-   Reclaiming a Docusign account deletes the account. The Docusign admin can access the user's files through the Docusign admin portal.
-   Reclaiming a Google Workspace account deletes the account. All the files are moved from the Google Drive into a folder in the Google Workspace admin account that authenticated the integration. The name of the created folder is the deleted user's email address. All email messages are deleted when the account is reclaimed. To transfer email messages, use the Google data migration service before reclaiming the account.
-   Reclaiming a GitHub Enterprise Server account suspends the account. All issues, comments, repositories, gists, and other data that the user created is preserved.

    Reclaiming a GitHub Enterprise Cloud account removes the account from all enterprise organizations. If you restore a user membership within three months of reclamation, the user's access to the private forks of your organization repositories is restored.

-   Reclaiming a product license from a GoTo user account removes the user's access to that product. Without a license, users can’t sign in to the product. If you reclaim all product licenses from a user account, the account is automatically suspended. Suspended users remain on the account but can't sign in to any products.
-   Reclaiming a Jira account removes the user from all the associated Jira groups. Although the user can no longer access the Jira site, all content that was created by the user remains accessible to other users.
-   Reclaiming a Looker account removes the user's access to Looker. Without an active account, the user can’t sign in to the Looker portal. The user’s usage history and personal content is retained.
-   Reclaiming a Microsoft 365 subscription removes the user's access to the application, associated plans, and services. If a user has access to an application through a group membership, reclaiming the subscription removes the user from the group and revokes access to the subscription and its associated plans.
-   Reclaiming a Microsoft Entra ID SSO application subscription removes the user's access to the application. If a user has access to an application through a group membership, you can't remove the group membership through reclamation. To reclaim the subscription, remove the user from the group in the Azure AD portal and then select **Close Complete**.
-   Reclaiming a Miro account removes the user's access to Miro. Without an active account, the user can’t sign in to the Miro portal.
-   Reclaiming an Okta SSO application subscription removes the user's access to the application. If a user has access to an application through a group membership, you can't remove the group membership through reclamation. To reclaim the subscription, remove the user from the group in the Okta Developer Console and then set the reclamation candidate state to **Close Complete**.

-   Reclaiming a Salesforce Marketing Cloud account deactivates the user.
-   Reclaiming an SAP SuccessFactors account deactivates the account.
