# Integrating with CrowdStrike

Integrating your Software Asset Management application with the CrowdStrike enables you to view CrowdStrike active host sensors information and check license compliance.

**Note:** CrowdStrike currently doesn't support the APIs for integration in regulated environments, including US-GOV-1 \(GovCloud\) or US-GOV-2 CrowdStrike clouds.

**Important:** Minimize security risks and protect information by granting access only to the necessary user or API permissions.

|Process|Required user role in the CrowdStrike application|Authentication scopes|
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|Download consumption|Falcon administrator|Sensor usage scope with read permissions|

This process is applicable for Yokohama Patch 1, Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) 15.0.8, and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 version onwards. If you are on any version for Yokohama below Patch 1, refer [KB1801232](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=ef634dac83935610cdbbc430feaad3d9).

## Register a CrowdStrike OAuth application

Register the CrowdStrike OAuth application to access the CrowdStrike API and to receive a Client ID and Client secret.

### Before you begin

The CrowdStrike Integration Hub spoke must be active. For more information, see [CrowdStrike spoke](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=crowdstrike-spoke&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-integrate-applications&ft:locale=en-US).

CrowdStrike Role required: Falcon administrator

**Important:**

-   To use the Sensor Usage APIs, your API client must be assigned the Sensor usage scope with Read permissions.
-   Contact your account team to enable the following feature flags:
    -   Hourly usage data feature flag: This flag must be enabled for your Customer Identification \(CID\) to view hourly usage data.
    -   Aggregated usage data feature flag: This flag must be enabled to get aggregated usage data in multi-CID \(non-Flight Control\) accounts.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to [Falcon](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/) using your admin credentials.

2.  Navigate to **Support and resources** &gt; **API Clients and Keys**.

3.  Select **Create API Client**.

4.  Provide the client name and description.

5.  Select the **Read** check box for the **Sensor usage** scope.

6.  Select **Create**.

    The API client created screen is displayed.

7.  Copy the Client ID and Secret for later use.

8.  Select **Done**.


## Create a CrowdStrike integration profile

Create a CrowdStrike integration profile to track software subscriptions and optimize licensing for your CrowdStrike applications.

### Before you begin

The Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) must be installed from the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/).

ServiceNow Role required: admin or sam\_integrator

**Important:** You must select the **CrowdStrike Spoke** check box for this integration while installing optional features on the [Application Manager](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=application-manager&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US) page. For more information about choosing the required SaaS applications, see [Request SaaS License Management](../task/request-saas-license-management.md).

### About this task

If you’re using Software Asset Workspace, the option to create the CrowdStrike integration profile in Core UI is inactive.

**Note:** When upgrading to Yokohama patch 1 with Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) 15.0.8 and Software Asset Management \(sn\_itam\_samp\) 2.1.0 store applications installed, you must delete the entitlements for the existing CrowdStrike integration profiles. Then, create entitlements for various CrowdStrike products, such as Falcon Endpoint Protection and Falcon Discover, based on their license metrics. These metrics include Reserved Hourly Average Sensor and Sensor Subscription, which are found under the CrowdStrike license metric group.

-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the **Draft** state, create new integration profiles and delete the existing ones.
-   If any existing CrowdStrike profiles are in the **Published** state, their state changes to Draft.

If you are on any version for Yokohama below patch 1, refer [KB1801232](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=ef634dac83935610cdbbc430feaad3d9).

</table>8.  Select **Create and Get OAuth Token**.

    **Note:** For the role required to perform this step, refer to the [Minimal user permissions](integrate-with-crowdstrike.md#) table.

    The OAuth token is generated successfully.

9.  On the Integration Profile form, proceed with the Workload product mapping by selecting the **CrowdStrike Product Workload Mappings** tab.

    Workload mapping is essential for accurately associating specific products with the types of workloads they manage \(for example, servers, desktops, containers\). This is because CrowdStrike provides data on workloads and not direct product-to-machine connections. With workload mapping, you can correctly count license usage and ensure compliance. The system adds up the relevant workloads for each product based on this mapping, preventing over- or under-counting. This new approach replaces previous methods and aligns with how CrowdStrike now tracks usage, making it easier to manage compliance.

    1.  On the CrowdStrike Product Workload Mappings page, select **New**.

        **Note:** The software entitlements and software models must be created before proceeding to the next step.

        -   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Create entitlements in Software Asset Management classic](../task/track-software-rights.md).
        -   For more information on creating software entitlements in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Create entitlements in workspace](../task/create-entitlements-workspace.md).
        -   For more information on creating software entitlements using the Software Asset Management Playbook, see [Create entitlements using the guided walk-through](../task/guidedwalk-workspace.md).

-   **Sensor Subscription**: This metric calculates license usage by averaging endpoint counts over four consecutive weeks. Weekly endpoint counts are based on the total number of endpoints consumed in the previous seven days.


</td></tr></tbody>
</table>    3.  Select **Save**.

10. On the integration profile form, select **Validate Connection** to verify the connection and credential details of this integration.

    You can also validate connections before creating CrowdStrike product workload mappings.

    **Important:** You must provide the Workload product mapping before publishing the profile.

11. After the connection is verified and the workload product mapping is provided, select **Publish**.

12. In the Publish Confirmation dialog box, select **OK**.


### Result

This integration pulls or creates usage records in the CrowdStrike Product Usage \[samp\_crowdstrike\_product\_usage\] table and CAL records in the Client Access \[samp\_sw\_client\_access\] table.

### What to do next

If you want to set up multiple integration profiles with unique connections, create child aliases to manage different configurations and settings for each integration profile. For more information, see [Create a child alias to set up multiple integration profiles](../reuse/create-child-alias-saas.md).

Reconciliation also runs on your subscriptions as a scheduled job or on-demand. You can view your reconciliation results in the [License Workbench](sam-license-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Management classic application\) or the [License usage view](sam-workspace-workbench.md) \(Software Asset Workspace\). Use these results to determine your license compliance position and to remediate any non-compliance.

-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Management classic application, see [Run software reconciliation in Software Asset Management classic](../task/t_RunReconciliation.md).
-   For more information on running reconciliation in the Software Asset Workspace, see [Run software reconciliation in the workspace](../task/run-recon-workspace.md).
