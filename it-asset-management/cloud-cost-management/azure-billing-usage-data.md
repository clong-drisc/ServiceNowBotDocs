# Set up access to Microsoft Azure billing and usage data

Set up access to Microsoft Azure billing and usage data depending on your agreement type.

You can access the billing and usage data, by assigning an appropriate role to the Microsoft Azure service principal, depending on your agreement type: Enterprise Agreement \(EA\), Microsoft Customer Agreement \(MCA\), or Microsoft Partner Agreement \(MPA\). Accordingly, some of the following steps might be optional for you.

**Important:** The support for MCA accounts is available from Cloud Cost Management version 9.0 and later.

1.  [Create a Microsoft Azure service principal](../task/create-ms-azure-service-principal.md)
2.  For EA accounts - [Add the Enrollment Reader role to the Microsoft Azure service principal](../task/add-enrollment-reader-ms-azure.md)
3.  For MCA accounts - [Add the Billing Profile Reader role to the Microsoft Azure service principal](../task/add-billing-profile-reader-azure.md)
4.  [Create a record of Microsoft Azure credentials in Cloud Cost Management](../task/create-azure-credential-record-ccm.md)
5.  [Schedule and manage the jobs that download Azure billing data](../task/schedule-azure-billing-job.md)
