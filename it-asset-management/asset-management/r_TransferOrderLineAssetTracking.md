# Transfer order line asset tracking

As transfer order line actions are triggered, the stock information and states of any affected assets are updated. Consumables and non-consumables are tracked differently.

When an asset is included in a transfer order line, the following takes place:

-   A substate field on the asset form changes to reflect the transfer order line states
-   The Active TO option on the asset form is automatically selected to show that the asset is part of a transfer order and cannot be added to multiple transfer orders
-   The asset is removed from the pool of available assets and changed to a state of In Stock Pending Transfer

-   **[Transfer order line asset tracking of non-consumables](r_TrsferOrderLneAssetTrackNonConsum.md)**  
When transfer order line stages change for non-consumables, it affects asset substates.
-   **[Transfer order line asset tracking consumables](r_TrsferOrderLneAssetTrackConsum.md)**  
When a consumable is added to a transfer order line, the stock for the consumable is split into two records and the transfer order links to the newly created stock line.
