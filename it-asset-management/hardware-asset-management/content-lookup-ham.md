-   View the entire list of hardware products and model numbers in the Content Service
-   View the cumulative days remaining for the next content update

After you enter your criteria in the search bar, the search results are listed with the most relevant matches at the top. Filters on the left-hand side of the page assist you in further narrowing down your results.

Based on your search criteria the information in the Content Service is pulled from the following tables.

-   Hardware product \[sn\_hamp\_hw\_product\]
-   Hardware Model Library \[sn\_hamp\_hw\_product\_model\]

Select the search result that matches your criteria to display the details of the content record and related lists. The content record page opens in read-only mode.
