# Generate product compliance summaries by using Now Assist for SAM

Generate a comprehensive summary for a product that covers software deployment, license compliance, optimization, and issues. The detailed product compliance summary helps in gaining insights into your software assets and makes it easier to manage licenses.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_user

## About this task

**Important:** This Now Assist skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-intelligent-experiences&ft:locale=en-US).

Now Assist for SAM generates the product summaries by using reconciliation results, product life-cycle reports, and dashboards such as Discovered inventory, Normalization and content, and Health check.

**Note:** Health check details are shown only for Windows Server, SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

When you run reconciliation with grouping, product summarization and recommended actions are available only for the parent product results, not for the individual child product results.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace**.

2.  Select the License usage view.

3.  Select a publisher.

4.  On the Publisher details page, select a product.

5.  Select **Summarize**.

    The Now Assist for SAM application starts generating the summary for the selected product. After the summary is compiled, the results of the summary appear under different sections. Additionally, recommended actions are also automatically generated when you select **Summarize**.

    After it's generated, the product summary isn’t automatically saved. If you close the Publisher details page where you generated the summary, or if you reload the page, the product summary isn’t available. To regenerate the summary, select **Summarize**.

6.  You can perform the following actions on the generated summary.
