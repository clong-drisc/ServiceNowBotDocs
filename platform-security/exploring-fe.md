# Exploring Field Encryption

Learn the details of Field Encryption Starter and Field Encryption Enterprise

## Encryption-backed access control

By default, Field Encryption blocks all users, scripts, and system processes from accessing encrypted data. However, Field Encryption has an access control feature that is used in combination with, but also separate from, Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) to ensure only the correct users, scripts, or system processes can access encrypted data.

You can configure Field Encryption’s access control feature through a combination of Field Encryption Modules, Encrypted Field Configurations, and Module Access Policies. The next image shows how these three components work together.

Module Access Policies \(shown in the next image\) are how users, scripts, or system processes can be authorized to access encrypted data \(but by default, the encrypted data is locked down from any access in the instance\).

</table>## Field Encryption and record history

Changes to fields encrypted with Field Encryption are not tracked in the activity stream for the record or in the record history \[sys\_history\_set\] table.

## Encryption on system tables

Field Encryption currently doesn’t support the encryption of fields and attachments of system tables \(tables that begin with sys\_\).
