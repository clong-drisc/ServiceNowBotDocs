# Enforce field ACLs for inbound query requests

Manage how incoming queries are validated on your instance.

Use the **glide.export.query.enforce\_field\_acl** property to check how incoming queries are validated on your instance. If the property is set to the recommended value of **true**, field ACLs are checked against incoming queries, and rejected if the user is unauthorized. If the property is set to **false**, ACLs are not checked against incoming queries and continue to execute which can lead to information disclosure to unauthorized parties.
