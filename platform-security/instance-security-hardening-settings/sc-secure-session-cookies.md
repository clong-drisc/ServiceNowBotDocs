# Enforce strict security of session cookies \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.ui.secure\_cookies** property to require properly formatted cookies

When you set the property is to true, your instance will reject a session if the associated cookie is not in the expected format.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
