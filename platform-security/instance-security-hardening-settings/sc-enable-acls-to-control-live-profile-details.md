# Enable ACLs to Control Live Profile Details \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.live\_profile.details** property to designate whether a user should be able to view all detail fields, such as company name and phone numbers, in a live profile.

Depending on the setting of the **glide.live\_profile.details** property, the following occur:

-   If the value is set to Show, access to the live profile information is granted, regardless of the ACLs created for the user profile.
-   If the value is set to ACL, access to the live profile information is restricted, as per the ACLs created for the user profile.
-   If the value is set to Hide, access to the live profile information is restricted, regardless of the ACLs created for the user profile.
