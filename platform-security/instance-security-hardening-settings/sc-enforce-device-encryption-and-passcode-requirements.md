# Enforce device encryption and passcode requirements \[New in Security Center 1.3\]

The **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** property enforces the Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS 140-2\) Encryption. Mobile device encryption and passcode ensure that an unauthorized user cannot access the content of a device even if the device is physically obtained.

When **glide.sg.device\_encryption\_enabled** is set to true, the ServiceNow mobile app will check that device encryption and device passcode are enabled.

When this property is set to true, the mobile app will verify if device encryption is enabled. If encryption is not enabled, users will not be allowed to log into the current instance on mobile.

 Users are logged out and see the following warning message, suggesting that they set a device pin or encrypt the device and to try to login again.

 ```
