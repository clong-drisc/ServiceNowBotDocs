# Enforce Strict User Image Upload

Use the **glide.security.strict.user\_image\_upload** property to enable Access Control for the upload/update of a profile picture when performed on a user record.

This setting opens the possibility of an unauthorized user uploading an image to another user's profile.

-   When you set this property to **true**, the table ACLs are enforced when uploading photos, only allowing authorized users to upload an image.
-   When you set it to **false**, ACLs are not enforced on image uploads to the Photo field.
