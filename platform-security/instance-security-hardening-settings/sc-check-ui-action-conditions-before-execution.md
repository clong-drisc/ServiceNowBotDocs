|---------|-----------|
|Property name|**glide.security.strict.actions**|
|Configuration type|System Properties \(/sys\_properties\_list.do\)|
|Category|[Access control](sc-access-control.md)|
|Purpose|To ensure an extra layer of validation on the table UI actions before they are executed.|
|Data type|boolean|
|Recommended value|true|
|Default value|true|
|Security risk rating|3.3|
|Functional impact|This remediation only adds an extra layer of validation to check for UI actions on the target table/page on the instance. As long as the access controls are set appropriately on the customer instance, there should not be an impact here.|
|Security risk|\(Low\) Access request is always checked when transactions happen between two zones. This operation validates any UI actions before the form renders for the end user.|
