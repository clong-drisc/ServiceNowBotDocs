# Restrict Impersonation to Admin \[New in Security Center 2.0\]

The **glide.sys.permissive.impersonate** property can be used to prevent non-admin roles from impersonating other users.

When the **glide.sys.permissive.impersonate** property is set to false, only users with the admin role can impersonate other users. When this property is set to true, users may be able to make use of application components that expose impersonation APIs to impersonate a user of higher privilege. This could result in unauthorized access if these application components are misconfigured because non-admin users can access the Impersonation functionality.

You may want to set the property to the non-default value when you need non-admin users to have the capability to impersonate other users.

**Warning:** This is a safe harbor property, meaning the value can't be altered once it's changed. It is non-revertible.
