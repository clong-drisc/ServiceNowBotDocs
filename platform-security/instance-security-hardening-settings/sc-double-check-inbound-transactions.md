# Double check inbound transactions \[Updated in Security Center 1.3\]

Use the **glide.security.strict.updates** property to enable double-checking of security on inbound transactions during form submission. When you set this property to **true**, it adds an extra layer of table validation before a form renders in the browser.

Ensure the property **glide.security.strict.updates** exists in the sys\_properties table and is set to true.

## More information

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Property name|**glide.security.strict.updates**|
|Configuration type|System Properties \(/sys\_properties\_list.do\)|
|Category|[Access control](sc-access-control.md)|
|Purpose|To ensure an added layer of verification of user permissions before presenting the form in the browser.|
|Data type|boolean|
|Recommended value|true|
|Default value|true|
|Security risk rating|8.1|
|Functional impact|This remediation adds an extra layer of validation to check for user permissions on the target table/page on the instance. As long as the access controls are set appropriately on the customer instance, there should be no impact.|
