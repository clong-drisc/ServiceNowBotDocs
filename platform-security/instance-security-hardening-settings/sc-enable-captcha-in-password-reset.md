# Enable CAPTCHA in password reset

Use the **password\_reset.captcha.ignore** property to enable or disable requiring a CAPTCHA challenge when a user resets their password.

Set **password\_reset.captcha.ignore** to the recommended value of **false** to require a CAPTCHA challenge for a user to reset their password. Set the value to **true** to ignore the CAPTCHA option for a password reset.

CAPTCHAs help prevent automation attacks by prompting the user for a challenge-response that is not easily answered by automated systems. If CAPTCHA is disabled, an attacker may be more successful during automated attacks against the password reset feature.

**Note:** This property is used for password reset automation only.
