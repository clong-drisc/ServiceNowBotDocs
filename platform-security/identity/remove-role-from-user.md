# Removing a Role from the user

Use the **Simulate Remove Role** for simulating the user's access changes for a resource \(tables\).

## Before you begin

Role required: admin, access\_analyzer\_admin

Enable the take actions. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](configure-access-simulator.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Access Analyzer** &gt; **Access Simulator**.

2.  Select **Simulate** from the Remove a Role from the user section.

3.  Specify the following fields for your simulation criteria:

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Select user \*|Specify a user name to select from the list. In this example, **Abel Tuter**.|
    |Select role \*|Specify a role to select from the list. In this example, **itil**.|
    |Rule type \*|Rule type is auto-populated and it can’t be changed.|
    |Select table \*|Specify a table name to select from the list. In this example, **Incident**.|
    |Select record|Specify a record name to select from the list.|
    |Select field|Specify a field name to select from the list. This field can be used to analyze permission even at a field level. For example, Active, Created By, and so on.|

    **Note:**

    -   If you want to know more about the ACL \(operations\), select the operation links for each record.
    -   If you want to start the simulation again for a different role, select **Start over**.
    -   If you want to exit the simulation, select **Exit**.
8.  Select **Next**.

9.  Select **Remove and complete**.

    **Note:**

    -   If the Access Simulator isn’t enabled, you can't complete the simulation. To enable, select **Enable actions** and accept the legal information.
    -   If you want to hide the simulation, select **Hide actions**. To unhide and enable actions, go to the settings. For more information, see [Configuring the Access Simulator \(Take actions\)](configure-access-simulator.md).
    -   If you want to exit the simulation, select **Skip and Exit**.
    The roles are successfully removed from the user. You can verify the access using the Access Analyzer. For more information about how to verify the access of a user, see [Access Analyzer](../concept/access-analyzer.md).
