# Real time anonymization

Use the real time anonymization\(RTA\) policy to anonymize data entries in real time.

Users create an RTA policy through the [Anonymization Policies page](../task/dps-create-anonymization-policies.md). Columns from the [target tables](../../security/task/configure-data-discovery-target-table.md) may be selected for RTA, whereupon [active data patterns](../../security/task/configure-data-discovery-patterns.md) are used and their policies applied to any valid record entries to the columns targeted for RTA. If an entry matches an active data pattern its associated [anonymization technique](../task/dps-create-anonymization-techniques.md) will be used for anonymization.

**Tip:** If you need to change the anonymization technique see [Configure Data Discovery patterns](../../security/task/configure-data-discovery-patterns.md).

## Data channels for real time anonymization

A data channel is the channel taken by your data for processing. See [Data channels for real-time anonymization policies](../reference/data-channels-for-rta.md) for more information.

## Real time anonymization failures

If an RTA policy fails, you can review its status with the [Real time anonymization failures](../../security/task/real-time-anonymization-failures.md) table.
