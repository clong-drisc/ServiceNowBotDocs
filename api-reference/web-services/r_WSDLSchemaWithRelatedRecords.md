# WSDL Schema with related records

When a WSDL for the target Incident table is requested with an additional parameter of **hierarchical=true**, the WSDL schema for the Insert function will reflect available related records that may participate in the hierarchical data payload.

For example, the insert portion of the schema of the incident table, when requested with **hierarchical=true** displays its hierarchy as follows:

`https://instance.service-now.com/incident.do?WSDL&hierarchical=true`

...

The WSDL above shows the incident table having a related table `u_custom_comments` that itself has a related table `u_comment_items`.
