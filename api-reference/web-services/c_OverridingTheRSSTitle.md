# RSS title override

You may optionally override the automatically generated title of the RSS feed by added the **sysparm\_title** parameter to the request URL.

For example, you can specify the title `Priority One Incidents` using the following request URL.

```
 https://<instance name>.service-now.com/incident.do?sysparm_query=priority=1&sysparm_view=ess&RSS&sysparm_title=Priority%20One%20Incidents

```

This will produce results as follows:
