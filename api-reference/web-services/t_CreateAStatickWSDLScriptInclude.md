# Create a static WSDL script include

Create a script include to define the majority of the code used to process static WSDL requests.

## About this task

By implementing the majority of the custom functionality in a script include, you can reuse the script include in multiple areas.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System UI** &gt; **Script Includes**.

2.  Click **New**.

3.  Enter a **Name** for the script include that matches the name of the static WSDL, such as FakeStockValue.

4.  Enter the script include code in the **Script** field.

5.  Click **Submit**.
