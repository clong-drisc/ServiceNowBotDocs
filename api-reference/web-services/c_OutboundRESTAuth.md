# Outbound REST authentication

Outbound REST messages support multiple types of authentication.

Different web service providers may require a specific type of authentication. Outbound REST supports the following authentication formats.

-   Basic authentication using a username and password
-   OAuth 2.0 using an OAuth provider and profile
-   Mutual authentication using protocol profiles

## Limitations of RESTMessage

There are few options which are only available in REST Step which is not supported in RESTMessage:

-   Mutual authentication and OAuth 2.0: Mutual authentication is not available with OAuth 2.0. It is supported only with basic authentication.
-   Custom authentication \(AWS, etc.\): AWS credentials and other custom authentication methods are supported only with REST Step, not with the RestMessage API.
-   Legacy API: The legacy RESTMessage APIs do not support current authentication formats. Use RESTMessageV2 API instead.

## Overriding REST authentication

You can define authentication for a REST message, or individually for each HTTP method. HTTP methods inherit authentication from their parent REST message record when the HTTP method **Authentication type** is **Inherit from parent**, which is the default value.

You can disable authentication for a specific HTTP method by setting the **Authentication type** field to **No authentication**, or specify authentication that is different from the parent REST message by selecting basic auth or OAuth.

## Authentication requirements

Authentication requirement for REST Outbound are as follows:

-   Outbound REST supports mutual authentication only when using basic authentication. Mutual authentication is not available with OAuth 2.0.
-   OAuth 2.0 can be used only with messages that are not configured to use a MID Server. You cannot send OAuth 2.0 authenticated messages through a MID Server. Also, mutual authentication is not supported with MID Server.
-   When scripting new REST messages configured with authentication you must use the RESTMessageV2 API. The legacy RESTMessage APIs do not support current authentication formats.
-   AWS credentials or any other custom authentication are supported only with the [REST step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=rest-request-action-designer&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-integrate-applications&ft:locale=en-US), not with the RestMessage API.

-   **[Configure a REST message with basic auth](../task/t_ConfigureRESTMsgBasicAuth.md)**  
Configure an outbound REST message to provide basic authentication credentials with each request.
-   **[Configure a REST message with OAuth](../task/t_ConfigureARESTMessageWithOAuth.md)**  
You can configure an outbound REST message to send OAuth credentials with the request.
-   **[Outbound REST mutual authentication](c_OutboundRESTMutualAuthentication.md)**  
Mutual authentication causes the web service provider and consumer to authenticate with each other before communicating.
