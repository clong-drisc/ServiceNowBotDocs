# AP Invoice API

Allows external systems, such as those used by vendors, to securely submit invoices directly into an accounts payable system in a structured and automated manner.

This API requires the Accounts Payable Invoice Processing \(com.sn\_ap\_apm\) store application, which is provided within the `sn_spend_intg` namespace. For information, see [Accounts Payable Invoice Processing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=acc-pay-invoice-processing&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-source-to-pay-operations&ft:locale=en-US).

Refer to [AP Invoice API Developer Guide](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#) for help with the following tasks:

-   Define a custom field for invoices, invoice lines, and invoice tax lines.
-   Map the custom field between source and target tables.
-   Map the custom field to a payload entry in a specific format, such as JSON, cXML, or XML.
-   Setting credentials for authentication when using cXML as the payload.

**Note:** The maximum default payload size is 100 records. This value is configurable in the **sn\_spend\_intg.ap.invoice.create.api.record\_limit** system property.

**Parent Topic:**[REST API reference](../../../build/applications/concept/api-rest.md)

## AP Invoice – POST sn\_spend\_intg/ap\_invoice/cxml

Processes an automated invoice in commerce XML \(cXML\) format.

Use the Invoice integration field mappings \[sn\_spend\_intg\_invoice\_intg\_field\_mapping\] table to determine how the fields are mapped to cXML tags.

For additional cXML resources, refer to the **cXML Reference Guide** at [https://xml.cxml.org](https://xml.cxml.org/current/cXMLReferenceGuide.pdf).

Credentials for this API are included in the payload. You can set up credentials in the Source system credential \[sn\_spend\_intg\_source\_system\_credential\] table. For instructions, see [Setting credentials for authentication in the cXML payload](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#).

You can define custom invoice fields for the request body. Use the following flow to add custom fields, map them to target tables, and format them for availability in the payload:

1.  [Add custom fields for invoice import](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)
2.  [Map custom fields between source and target tables](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)
3.  [Map custom fields to a payload source format](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)

## AP Invoice – POST sn\_spend\_intg/ap\_invoice/json

Processes an automated invoice in JSON format.

Role required: sn\_spend\_intg.procurement\_integrator

Use the Invoice integration field mappings \[sn\_spend\_intg\_invoice\_intg\_field\_mapping\] table to determine how the fields are mapped to JSON properties.

You can define custom invoice fields for the request body. Use the following flow to add custom fields, map them to target tables, and format them for availability in the payload:

1.  [Add custom fields for invoice import](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)
2.  [Map custom fields between source and target tables](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)
3.  [Map custom fields to a payload source format](../../guides/APInvoiceAPI/concept/apInvoice-dev-guide.md#)
