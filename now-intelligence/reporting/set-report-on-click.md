# Set the on-click behavior of a report

You can configure a URL to open when you select a section of a report.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   When creating reports: Any
-   When editing reports created by others: report\_admin, report\_global, or report\_group

## About this task

Redirect the user to a URL rather than to the configured drilldown or the list that underlies the selected section of a report.

See [Define a report drilldown](../concept/c_DrillingDownWithinReports.md#) for the report types that don't support the drilldown feature.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Reports** &gt; **View / Run**.

2.  Select the report that you want to configure.

3.  Select the **Show report structure** icon \(![Show report structure](../image/Form_ShowReportStructureIcon.png)\).

4.  Select the link icon \(![](../image/link-icon.png).

5.  In the **Set redirect URL** dialog box, enter relative link within the instance, for example, `/$knowledge.do?sys_id=123`.

    When the user points to the report, the tooltip includes the text **Click to open**.

6.  Enter a label for the URL.

    When the user points to the report, the tooltip includes the text **Click to open** and the text of the label, for example, Click to open Knowledge Base.

7.  Select **Save**.

## Result

When you select the report, the redirect URL replaces any drilldown functionality.
