# Configure extreme duration finding definition

Configure an extreme duration finding definition to view a pattern where transitions take significantly longer than the usual duration between the steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

Extreme duration finding definition displays transitions that take significantly longer than the median duration. This helps uncover potential duration anomalies.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about the Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the Extreme duration card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

    For details, see [Rule-based finding definition form from Finding Builder](../reference/finding-definition-form.md).

4.  Select **Configure**.

    The **Configure** tab is displayed.

5.  Fill the details on the form.

    Default values are provided. You can edit them if needed.

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and Insights page:

    -   Records that take the minimum time, which is the number of times specified multiplied by the median duration.
    -   Only 2% of the total records will be included so that a large number of records are not displayed. Also, a minimum of 20 records will be considered.
    -   Only the top five extreme duration transitions are displayed in the Summary and Insights page.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
