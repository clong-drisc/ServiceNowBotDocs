## Schedule job for version cleanup

Schedule a job to delete older backup versions and clean up cluster analysis records by executing the scheduled script **ProminVersionCleanup**.

### Before you begin

Role required: administrator

### About this task

When regenerating projects, the **ProminVersionCleanup** job deletes obsolete, cached statistics. The older statistics move into a previous version, while the new version is created for the updated project.

When regenerating or deleting projects, this job cleans records created during cluster analyses.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Mining** &gt; **Background Jobs**.

2.  Select the scheduled job **ProminVersionCleanup**.

3.  Check or set the following.

4.  1.  Enable the **Active** check box.
2.  Check if the Run field is **Daily**.
3.  Set the Time in hours.
5.  Select **Execute Now**.


### Result

Backup version and cluster record cleanup execute daily.
