# Configure rework finding definition

Configure a rework finding definition to view a pattern where a step in the process is repeated.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

Rework finding definition displays repeated process steps. This helps in identifying situations where there could be frequent repetition of work.
