# Configure extreme repetitions finding definition

Configure an extreme repetitions finding definition to view a pattern where a transition repeats more than the usual repetition range between the steps.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_process\_optimization\_analyst, sn\_process\_optimization\_power\_user, or sn\_process\_optimization\_admin

Extreme repetitions finding definition surfaces transitions that are repeated significantly more than the median repetition. This helps uncover potential repetition anomalies.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to Improvement opportunity definition page.

    For information about the Improvement opportunity definition page, see [Set improvement opportunities](improve-opportunities.md).

2.  Select **Create** on the Extreme repetitions card.

    For a particular type of automated finding, you can create a maximum of two automated findings.

3.  Provide details in the **Define** section.

    For details, see [Rule-based finding definition form from Finding Builder](../reference/finding-definition-form.md).

4.  Select **Configure**.

    The **Configure** tab is displayed.

5.  Fill the details on the form.

    Default values are provided. You can edit them if needed.

    According to the example, records that meet the following conditions are available as improvement opportunities in the Summary and Insights page:

    -   Records that take the minimum time, which is the number of times specified multiplied by the median duration. In the example, it is 20\*median duration.
    -   Only 2% of the total records are included so that a large number of records aren’t displayed. Also, a minimum of 20 records is considered.
    -   Only the top five extreme duration transitions are displayed in the Summary and Insights page as improvement opportunities.
6.  Select **Save and exit**.
