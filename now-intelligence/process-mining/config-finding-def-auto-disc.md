Role required: administrator

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Mining** &gt; **Process Configuration**.

2.  Select the Incident table \[incident\].

3.  Use the **KPI Dashboard** field to select a KPI dashboard to associate with this process configuration.

4.  Navigate to the **Automation Discovery** tab.

5.  Select **Enable automation discovery** and **Auto-run with model generation**, and complete the required fields.

    Your project runs automation discovery with model generation automatically when both options are selected.

6.  Select **Update**.

7.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Mining** &gt; **Process Mining Workspace**.

    The Process Mining Workspace page opens.

8.  Open the project, and select **Automation Opportunities**

    Your project's results are broken up into two categories: **Automation Opportunities** and **Not Categorized**.![auto discovery process map](../image/auto-disc-process-map.png)

9.  Select a record for additional information.

    Point to **Open process map** to trigger additional mining.

    If you decide not to select **Enable automation discovery** or **Auto-run with model generation**, your Automation Opportunities don’t display. From the **Analyst Workbench**, select **Generate report** to create a report.
