# Content not migrated or migrated in compatibility mode

Most dashboard content is migrated to the new Platform Analytics experience. However, some visualizations, aspects of visualizations, and filters are inserted in the migrated dashboard as embedded content \(iframes\), also known as compatibility mode. Some configurations are not migrated at all.

**Note:** If you have already migrated to Platform Analytics experience, the Migration Center automatically migrates any previously incompatible content that is now compatible when you upgrade releases.

## Compatibility mode migrations

Migration in compatibility mode means that the original artifacts are inserted into the migrated dashboard in iframes. The original content is not changed or moved.

All custom interactive filters, custom content blocks, gauges, and gadgets are migrated in compatibility mode, as iframes.

All other content that is not a Performance Analytics widget, report, or interactive filter is migrated in compatibility mode, as iframes.

**Note:** Dashboards with visualizations or other widgets migrated in compatibility mode may experience performance issues.

Custom interactive filters are migrated in compatibility mode, but may not work on the migrated dashboard. If the custom functionality is required, roll the dashboard back to the Core UI version.
