# Dashboard elements

Elements refer to the visual objects you can place on a dashboard, including filters.

Dashboards contain a combination of visual elements to show data.

-   **Analytics list**

    TBD

-   **[Data visualization](../../performance-analytics/concept/analytics-center-data-visualizations.md)**

    Data visualizations enable you to present a visual representation of current instance data or temporary data that you’ve imported. Data visualizations include visualizations that you create in the dashboard designer and data visualizations from the library.

    **Important:** You cannot place reports or Performance Analytics widgets on a Platform Analytics dashboard. You must create data visualizations instead.

-   **[Filter](../../par-for-workspace/concept/interactive-filters-workspace.md)**

    Filters enable users to filter the visualizations on a dashboard based on specified criteria. You can put filters either on the individual tabs or above the tabs so that the filter applies to elements every tab. Filters include both data filters and domain filters. You can create filters in the dashboard designer or select them from the library.

-   **[Filter group](../../par-for-workspace/task/create-filter-group.md)**

    A set of filters that you can apply simultaneously. Use when you have multiple filters that can apply to multiple visualizations.

-   **[Heading](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/xanadu/now-components/now-heading/usage)**

    Headings provide a place for text at the top of a dashboard or section of a dashboard. Formatting for headings is limited to six heading levels.

-   **[Image](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/xanadu/now-components/now-image/uib-config)**

    Image elements hold static or animated images on the dashboard.

-   **[List - Simple](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/now-experience/xanadu/shared-components/now-record-list-connected-snapshot/usage)**

    Simple lists show table data that you can customize for the dashboard audience.

-   **[Process Mining - Map](../../par-for-workspace/task/configure-po-map.md)**

    Map the different states that are part of your process and the transitions between those states. See which states the objects of the process are in and the speed with which they change state. Requires an existing Process Mining project.

-   **Rich text**

    Rich text elements hold text that you can format either as text or as html, including font selection, text size, highlighting, and hyperlinks. To edit HTML markup, open the HTML editor from the Configuration panel and select the Code tags &lt; &gt; icon.


## Default element dimensions

Each element has a default height and width when you place it on the stage to configure. Select and drag an element's handlebar to resize it.

-   **Filter**

    six columns by three rows

-   **List, Multipivot, and Indicator Scorecard visualizations**

    48 columns by 18 rows

-   **All other components**

    11 columns by 11 rows
