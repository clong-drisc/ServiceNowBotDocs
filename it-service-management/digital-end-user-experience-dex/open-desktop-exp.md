        -   Select **Log in**.
        -   Allow Desktop Assistant to connect to your ServiceNow account by selecting **Allow**.

            **Note:** To have an SSO login, you should set up the SSO provider and configure SSO in the instance. To learn more about configuring SSO, see [Configure OAuth details](configure-oauth-details.md).

    -   When you have Single Sign-On \(SSO\):
        -   Select the **Login with SSO** link.
