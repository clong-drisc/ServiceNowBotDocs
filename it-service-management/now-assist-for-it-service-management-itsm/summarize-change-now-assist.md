## About this task

A change request summary provides you with a concise summary of a change request. The summary is based on the change request state and is generated from the information that you enter in the following fields:

-   Short description
-   Description
-   Work notes
-   Additional comments
-   Risk
-   Impact
-   Justification
-   Implementation plan
-   Risk and impact analysis
-   Test plan
-   Backout plan
-   Close code
-   Close notes
-   Service offering
-   State
-   Conflict status
-   Type

For information about the change request states, see [State progression for normal, standard, and emergency changes](../../change-management/concept/normal-standard-emergency-states.md).

You can summarize a change request in Core UI and Service Operations Workspace for ITSM.

**Important:** This Now Assist skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-intelligent-experiences&ft:locale=en-US).

## Procedure

1.  In Core UI or Service Operations Workspace for ITSM, open a change request that is assigned to you.

2.  Select **Summarize**.

    **Note:** The Summarize UI action isn’t available for the New or Canceled state.

    The summary appears in a banner on the change request record in Core UI.![Change summary in Core UI](../image/itsm-now-assist-change-summary-core-ui.png)

    The summary appears in the **Overview** tab on the change request record in Service Operations Workspace.
