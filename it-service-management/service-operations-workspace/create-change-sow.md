Service

</td><td>

The business service that you want to make available for the change request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Category

</td><td>

The category of the change, for example, **Hardware**,  **Network**, **Software**, **Other**, **DevOps**, and so on.**Note:** The section to **Add DevOps data** \(step 8 in this procedure\) is enabled only when the category is selected as **DevOps**. For DevOps models, the category is automatically set to DevOps.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Affected CIs

</td><td>

Associate CIs with a single change request.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Propose mass CI update

</td><td>

If the CI does not have any change group, then the field gets populated with the change group available for service offerings. The business rule **Populate Assignment Group based on CI/SO** triggers the functionality when an incident, problem, or change request is created or updated and when the **Assignment group** and the **Assigned to** field is empty. The following properties identify the field whose value populates the **Assignment group** field:

-   **com.snc.change\_request.ci\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: This change property identifies which CI field populates the **Assignment group** field.
-   **com.snc.change\_request.service\_offering\_assignment\_group.field\_name**: This change property identifies which service offering field populates the **Assignment group** field.
**Note:** The default value for the properties is support group for incident or problem and change group for change request respectively. The business rule **Populate Assignment Group based on CI/SO** is shipped as part of the development plugin ITSM CSDM Best Practice – Quebec plugin \(com.snc.best\_practice.itsm\_csdm.quebec\) and is available only for the new customers.
