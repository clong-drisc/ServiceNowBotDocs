# Work on a problem in Service Operations Workspace

Manage problems and problem tasks through their life cycle, share workarounds or fixes with related incidents, and create known error articles to help deflect incidents.

## Before you begin

If you aren't using the base problem life cycle, you will continue to use the classic experience to manage problems or problem tasks through their life cycle. From the problem record page, select **Continue problem** to be redirected to the ServiceNow AI Platform user interface where you can make state transitions. For information about state transitions of a problem, see [Life cycle of a problem](../../problem-management/concept/understanding-state-mgmt-transitions.md).

The base problem life cycle is included with the Problem Management  Best Practice - Madrid - State Model \(com.snc.best\_practice.problem.madrid.state\_model\) plugin. Use the Problem Management Migration Utility [store application](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/d03b7539dbbb3300f21e7ffdbf9619a8) to enable this plugin and migrate your records to the base problem life cycle.

Role required: itil, problem\_coordinator or higher \(for managing the life cycle of the problem\), problem\_admin \(for deleting the problem\)

1.  Open a problem.

    For information about creating a problem in Service Operations Workspace, see [Create a problem in Service Operations Workspace](create-problem-sow.md).
