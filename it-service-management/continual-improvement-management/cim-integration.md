# Improvement integration with other applications

You can create an improvement request from within multiple integrated applications. You can also create many application tasks from within an improvement initiative. Set the Continual Improvement Management attributes property to determine which field values get copied to integrated application tasks.

Set Continual Improvement Management properties for integration with other applications.

As part of Continual Improvement Management integration with other applications, improvement requests can be created from within other applications and, conversely, records for other applications can be created from within an improvement initiative \(or CIM task\).

Multiple tasks from outside integrated applications can be linked to a single improvement initiative \(or CIM task\), and multiple CIM tasks can be linked to a single integrated application task for maximum flexibility when creating improvements.

An improvement initiative can be created from these applications.

-   [Benchmarks](../../benchmarks/reference/r_Benchmarks.md)
-   [Coaching](../../coaching/concept/coaching-landing.md)
-   Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)

-   Demand record
-   [Project](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ProjectApplicationOverview&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-it-business-management&ft:locale=en-US) \(optional\)

-   [Coaching opportunity](../../coaching/task/create-coaching-opportunity.md)
-   [Create a knowledge article](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-knowledge-article&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-servicenow-platform&ft:locale=en-US)
