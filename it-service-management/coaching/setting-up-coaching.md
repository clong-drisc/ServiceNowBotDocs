# Setting up Coaching and surveys

To take full advantage of Coaching, configure the Coaching application and set up surveys.

## Setting up Coaching

Configure Coaching to start assessing and coaching trainees.

1.  Set up Coaching [roles](../reference/coaching-roles.md) and groups to identify Coaching users, coaches, and admins.
2.  Define an assessment trigger on the Coaching Opportunity form.
3.  Identify training content that is provided as part of a training or virtual coaching.
4.  Configure virtual coaches to add to a coaching opportunity.
5.  Set up surveys to provide feedback on the coaching experience so you can make improvements.

## Setting up surveys

You can obtain feedback for both the coach and the trainee by creating surveys that are accessed from a Coaching Assessment form that has been resolved or closed.

-   Survey taken by trainee to provide feedback on the coach
-   Survey taken by coach to provide feedback on the trainee
