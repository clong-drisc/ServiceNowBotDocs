# Activate Incident Management Notification

You can activate the Incident Management Notification plugin \(com.snc.incident\_notification\) if you have the admin role. This plugin includes demo data and activates related plugins if they are not already active.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Applications** &gt; **All Available Applications** &gt; **All**.

2.  Find the plugin using the filter criteria and search bar.

    You can search for the plugin by its name or ID. If you cannot find a plugin, you might have to request it from ServiceNow personnel.

3.  Select **Install** to start the installation process.

    **Note:** When domain separation and delegated admin are enabled in an instance, the administrative user must be in the **global** domain. Otherwise, the following error appears: `Application installation is unavailable because another operation is running: Plugin Activation for <plugin name>.`

    You will see a message after installation is completed. For information about the components installed with a plugin, see [Find components installed with an application](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/yokohama-platform-administration/page/administer/plugins/task/find-components.html).
