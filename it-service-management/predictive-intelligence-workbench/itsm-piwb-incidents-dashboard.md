# ITSM Predictive Intelligence Workbench dashboard

ITSM Predictive Intelligence Workbench provides the Predictive Intelligence for Incidents dashboard to enable you to measure the value of using machine learning to automate your IT business processes. Monitor use case models and view associated statistics. Effectively demonstrate business value to stakeholders with dashboard views.

**Important:**

Starting with the yokohama release, the ITSM Predictive Intelligence Workbench will reach its end of life \(EOL\) as part of its deprecation process. It will be completely deprecated and no longer deployed, enhanced, or supported from the yokohama release. To get the latest experience for this functionality, you must install the Task Intelligence for ITSM application \(com.snc.itsm\_ml\_task\) plugin. For more information, see [Task Intelligence for ITSM](../../../product/task-intelligence-for-itsm/concept/c-itsm-task-intelligence.md)

For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

Know exactly what stage your model workflows are in with automated comments on specific ServiceNow® Performance Analytics indicators. Comments appear on the **Actual Net Automation** indicators. Model stages comments include, when the model is integrated, when an integration is removed, when an existing model is changed to a new model, and when retraining is complete.

![Predictive Intelligence for Incidents dashboard Monitoring Models tab](../../../product/itsm-predictive-intel-workbench/image/PIWBMonitoringModels-pt1.png "Monitoring Models tab")

You can view the Net Automation Threshold graph on the **Monitoring Models** tab. This threshold is a computation of the difference between estimated net automation and the underperformance property values. Thresholds are calculated daily and notifications are sent to stakeholders when thresholds are breached.

View automatic comments on the **Actual Net Automation** indicator at various stages of the model monitoring. A comment is generated when any of the following model criteria exists:

-   Model is integrated
-   Model integration is removed
-   Existing model is changed to a new model
-   Integrated model is retrained

</table>## Indicators

-   **Prediction Coverage for Incident**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula: `if ([[Number of attempted predictions based on Created Today for Incident]]==0){0}else{[[Number of applied predictions based on Created Today for Incident]]/[[Number of attempted predictions based on Created Today for Incident]]*100}`.

-   **Number of predicted results based on final value date for incident**

    The number of predicted results is based on the final value date for an incident. The score is measured daily as unit \#.

-   **Net Automation for Incident**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula: `[[Prediction Precision for Incident]]*[[Prediction Coverage for Incident]]/100`.

-   **Number of applied predictions based on Created Today for Incident**

    Number of applied predictions based on Created Today for Incident is measured daily as unit \#.

-   **Number of attempted predictions based on Created Today for Incident**

    Number of attempted predictions based on Created Today for Incident is measured daily as unit \#.

    The goal for this indicator is to maximize the quality of predictions.

-   **Prediction Precision for Incident**

    The score for this indicator is calculated according to the formula: `if ([[Number of predicted results based on final value date for Incident]]==0){0}else{[[Number of successful predictions not skipped based on final value date for Incident]]/[[Number of predicted results based on final value date for Incident]]*100}`.

-   **Estimated Net Automation**

    Estimated net automation measured daily as unit %.

-   **Number of successful predictions not skipped based on final value date for Incident**

    Number of successful predictions not skipped based on final value date is measured daily as unit \#. It is the count on data source MLPredictorResults.FinalValueDate.Incident, which is using the table: ml\_predictor\_results.

-   **Number of Predicted for Incidents**

    Number of Predicted for Incidents is measured daily as unit \#. It is the count on data source MLPredictorResults.CreatedToday.Incident, which is using the table: ml\_predictor\_results.

</table>**Note:** Regarding source tables, all indicators and reports are built off of newly added database views, combining ServiceNow platform Predictive Intelligence tables with Predictive Intelligence Workbench use case tables. With these new views, you can filter platform data by use case to better understand its impact on your metrics. All database views for this content application have a prefix of sn\_piwb\_itsm\_conte\_dbv.
