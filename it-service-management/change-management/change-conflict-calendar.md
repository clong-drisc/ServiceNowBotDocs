# Conflict calendar

The conflict calendar graphically represents the potential scheduling conflicts for a change request. Conflicts are identified as active change requests, blackout schedules, and changes scheduled outside maintenance schedules. Use the **Scheduling Assistant** to resolve any schedule conflicts.
