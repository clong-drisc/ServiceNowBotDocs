# Exclude access for specific groups in Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace

You can remove access to assignment group data and display only the assignment groups that are relevant for the logged-in user in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Workforce Optimization for ITSM** &gt; **Manager Workspace Configuration** &gt; **Group Exclusions**.

2.  On the **Groups not included in WFO** form, select **New**.

3.  In the **Name** field, enter a meaningful name for one or more groups you want to exclude from displaying in the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace.

4.  Set the filter conditions to exclude the groups.

    For example, if you define a condition as **\[Name\]** **\[does not contain\]****\[Support\]**, then the Workforce Optimization for ITSM manager workspace doesn't display any groups that contain Support in the group name.
