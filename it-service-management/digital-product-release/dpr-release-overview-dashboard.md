</table>## Calculation of risk score of a release

The risk score of a release combines overdue task scores and policy failure scores, weighted by their respective importance. The weight or priority to overdue tasks and policy failure determines their urgency or impact on a release. The overdue task score is categorized based on the percentage of overdue tasks. The policy failure score is determined by the percentage of failed policies.

Given `overdue_weight + policy_failure_weight = 1`, the risk score of a release is calculated according to the following formula:

`Risk score = Round((Overdue task score * overdue_weight + Policy failure score * policy_failure_weight) * (Number of days elapsed in release / Total number of days in release))`

Where each metric is calculated as follows:

-   **Overdue task score:**

    -   If &lt;10% of tasks are overdue, the overdue task score is 0.
    -   If 10-40% of tasks are overdue, the overdue task score is 1.
    -   If &gt;40% of tasks are overdue, the overdue task score is 2.
    If a task has no end date, the phase's end date is used as the task's due date.

-   **Policy failure score:**
    -   If &lt;10% of policies fail, the policy failure score is 0.
    -   If 10-40% of policies fail, the policy failure score is 1.
    -   If &gt;40% of policies fail, the policy failure score is 2.

Based on the calculated risk score, the release is categorized into one of the following risk levels:

-   Low, if the value is 0 or 1
-   Medium, if the value is 2
-   High, if the value is 3
-   Very high, if the value is 4

This categorization can help you determine the risks involved with the release, thus enabling you to take measures to reduce these risks in a timely manner.
