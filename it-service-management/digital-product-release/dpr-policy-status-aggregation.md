# Policy status aggregation

In a multi-product release, the policy run status of releases for all primary and included products are rolled up to the policy status of the main release.

## Example of a policy status aggregation

Consider a release with a primary product or service and three related products. Each phase has policies mapped to it. You can run policies on the current phase from the main release or from an included product release.

The following table shows how the aggregated status is calculated from the status of each release.

|Status for primary product or service|Status for Included product 1|Status for Included product 2|Status for Included product 3|Aggregated status|
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
|Not run|Not run|Not run|Not run|**Not run**|
|Not run|Non-compliant|Non-compliant|Non-compliant|**Not run**|
|Not run|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant|**Not run**|
|Non-compliant|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant|**Non-compliant**|
|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant|**Compliant**|
|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant|Compliant with exception|**Compliant with exception**|
