# Create a release template

Create a release template to predefine the release process. The template contains templates for release phases, tasks, exit criteria for each of the phases, key dates,and approvals.

## Before you begin

Identify phases, tasks within each phase, exit criteria for each phase, key dates,and required approvals for a release. If there are different processes followed for each kind of release or product, you should create multiple release templates.

Role required: sn\_dpr\_model.release\_template\_admin orsn\_dpr\_model.release\_admin

## About this task

The release teams can use these templates to create a release. All the phases, tasks, key dates,approvals, and phases' exit criteria from the template are applied to the new release. The release template helps the release team track and perform all the required tasks to complete the release on time.

**Important:** After you mark an activity as done, you can't add or change phases, tasks, or map policies. So, be sure to review and verify all activity details before marking as done.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Digital Product Release Workspace**.

2.  Select the release administration icon \(![Release administration icon.](../image/dpr-icon-release-admin.png)\).

3.  On the Release administration page, select the **Release templates** tab.

4.  Create a release template or update an existing one.

    -   To create a release template, select **New**.
    -   To modify an existing release template, open the release template from the list.
5.  On the Create release template dialog box, add details like name and short description.

6.  From the **Type** list, select a release type.

7.  Select **Enable release to validate product versions** to determine if a release created from this template can validate a new product versions.

8.  Select **Create**.

    A release template is created and opens in the release template's Setup playbook page to define the template.

9.  In the Release Process activity, select between a timeline-oriented or stage-oriented release process.

    |Release process|Description|
    |---------------|-----------|
    |**Timeline-oriented process**|This release process is appropriate for creating releases that have fixed deadlines and that follow a strict schedule.|
    |**Stage-oriented process**|This release process is appropriate for creating releases that prioritize completing objectives and features over following a strict schedule.|

10. In the Phases activity, add phases to the release template.

    1.  Enter a unique phase name, the duration of the phase in days, and a short description.

        The **Duration** field appears only for the timeline-oriented process.The total duration for all phases in the template must be less than the duration set in the **sn\_dpr.max\_template\_duration** system property.

    2.  Select **Add new phase** to add another phase.

        Repeat the steps to add more phases as required.

    3.  In the **Release readiness target phase** section, choose a phase from the **Select phase** list to align it with the release readiness.

        The selected phase's end date is considered as the release readiness target date.

    4.  In the **Schedule** section, choose a schedule from the **Select schedule** list as the default schedule.

        The list shows the schedule entries from the Schedule \[cmn\_schedule\] table that are of the type Excluded.

        Adding a schedule considers holidays and weekends and adjusts the phase and release durations accordingly. This helps improve release planning accuracy by including actual working days. For more information, see [Holiday schedules in a release](../concept/dpr-release-holiday-schedule.md).

        **Note:** This option is available only for the timeline-oriented release process.

    5.  Select **Mark as done** to complete adding all required phases to the release template.

        The Phases activity is marked as complete and can’t be edited further. The Tasks activity becomes editable, displaying each phase in separate tabs.

11. In the Tasks activity, add tasks to each phase.

    1.  Select a phase tab in which you want to add a task.

    2.  In the **Task name** field, enter a unique name for the task.

    3.  In the **Need approval** field, select whether the task requires approval.

    4.  If approval is required for the task, select an approval definition from the **Approval definition** list.

        For more information, see [Create an approval definition in Digital Product Release](dpr-create-approval-definition.md).

    5.  Select **Add new task** to add another task to the phase.

    6.  After all tasks are added to the current phase, select **Next phase**.

        The tasks you added to the current phase are saved. The next available phase tab is selected so you can add tasks for that phase.

        Repeat the steps to add more tasks as required for each phase.

    7.  After all tasks are added to all available phases, select **Save** on the last phase tab.

    8.  Select **Mark as done** to complete adding tasks to phases as needed.

12. In the Key dates activity, add key dates as needed.

    **Note:** This activity is available only for the timeline-oriented release process.

    1.  Select a phase tab in which you want to add a key date.

    2.  Select **Add new key date** to add a key date to the phase.

        Alternatively, select anywhere on the timeline section. This action creates a key date with the number of days calculated and added to the new key date entry.

    3.  In the **Type** field, select the type of event to map to the phase.

    4.  In the **Key date** field, describe your key date.

    5.  Define your key date by selecting the number of days either from the beginning or before the end of the selected phase.

    6.  After all key dates are added, select **Mark as done** to complete adding key dates as needed.

        The Key dates activity is marked as complete and can’t be edited further. The Policies activity becomes editable, displaying each phase in separate tabs.

    When you create a release using the template, these key dates help you track the progress of the important events of the release.

13. In the Policies activity, map policies to each phase as needed.

    1.  Select a phase tab to which you want to map policies.

    2.  Select **Map policies**.

    3.  In the Map Policies dialog box, select policies from the list to map to the phase, and then select **Map policies**.

    4.  Select **Next phase** to save the mapped policies for the current phase and move to the next phase.

    5.  After policies are mapped to available phases, select **Save** from the last phase tab.

    6.  Select **Mark as done** to complete the Policies activity.

        The Policies activity is marked as complete and can’t be edited further.

    -   Select **Yes** to publish and activate the template.
    -   Select **No** to keep the template unpublished. You can publish and activate it later from the release template record form.
