# Create a service offering in Service Builder

Create a service offering to define and view the products or applications that make up your service in Service Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: service\_author or service\_editor

## About this task

2.  **Team**
3.  **Operations**
4.  **Financials**

**Tip:** You can cancel out of creating a service anytime by selecting the **Cancel** button \(next to the **Save** button\). Also, to return to the home page at any time while creating or editing a service, select ![Home icon.](../../digital-portfolio-management/image/home-polaris-primary2x.png).
