# Hermes Messaging Service activation

The Hermes Messaging Service is enabled when the Glide Hermes Message Queue plugin \(com.glide.hermes\) is activated.

This plugin isn't activated directly. Instead, the plugin is activated by any of the following actions:

-   Activation of the ServiceNow Stream Connect Installer \(com.glide.hub.stream\_connect.installer\) plugin
-   Installation of the Log Export Service application
-   Activation of the IDR plugin \(com.glide.idr\) in Utah or higher
-   Activation of the IDR plugin \(com.glide.idr\), and then a subsequent upgrade to Utah or higher

**Note:** Stream Connect requires an Workflow Data Fabric subscription and a Stream Connect subscription. For more information, see [https://www.servicenow.com/products/automation-engine.html](https://www.servicenow.com/products/automation-engine.html).
