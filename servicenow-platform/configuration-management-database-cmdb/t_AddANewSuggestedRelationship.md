# Add a suggested relationship

Add a suggested relationship for a class. The list of suggested relationships for a class is available when you create a new relationship for a CI of that class.

## Before you begin

Role required: To view — itil. To create, update, or delete suggested relationships — itil\_admin.

## Procedure

1.  Use the CI Class Manager \(Role required: itil\_admin\):

    1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **CI Class Manager**.

    2.  Click **Hierarchy** to expand the CI Classes list.

    3.  Select the class to add a suggested relationship to.

    4.  In the class navigation bar, click **Suggested Relationships**.

    5.  Click **New**.

    6.  In the Add Suggested Relationship dialog box, select a **Relationship** and a **Target Class** for the relationship. **This Class** and the **Target Class** become parent or child in the suggested relationship, based on your selection of the **Relationship**.

    7.  Click **Save**.

2.  Or, navigate to **All** &gt; **Configuration** &gt; **Relationships** &gt; **Suggested Relationships** \(Role required: admin\):

    1.  Click **New**.

    2.  Complete the form.

        |Field|Description|
        |-----|-----------|
        |Base class|The base class in the relationship, which depending on the relationship type, is either the parent or the child in the relationship.|
        |Relationship|Relationship type.|
        |Dependent class|The dependent class in the relationship, which depending on the relationship type, is either the parent or the child in the relationship.|

**Note:** The same parent class and relationship can appear more than once.

## What to do next

You may need to delete a suggested relationship, for example, to limit the choice of available relationships in the CI relationship editor. Removing a suggested relationship does not affect relationships that are created or updated by Discovery.
