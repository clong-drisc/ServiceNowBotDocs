# Install Conversational SMS service channel

You can install the Conversational SMS service channel application \(sn\_awa\_sms\_int\) if you have the admin role. The application installs related ServiceNow® Store applications and plugins if they are not already installed.

## Before you begin

-   Ensure that the application and all of its associated store applications have valid ServiceNow entitlements. For more information, see [Get entitlement for a ServiceNow product or application](https://store.servicenow.com/$appstore.do#!/store/help?article=KB0030186).
-   The Conversational Messaging plugin \(com.glide.messaging.awa\) must be installed.

    For more information on activating plugins, see [Activate a plugin](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_ActivateAPlugin&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US).


Role required: admin

## About this task

**Note:** The Conversational SMS service channel is automatically installed with an application that implements an SMS provider, such as the Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio \(sn\_va\_sms\_twilio\) application. For more information, see [Install Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=install-sms-twilio&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-conversational-interfaces&ft:locale=en-US).
