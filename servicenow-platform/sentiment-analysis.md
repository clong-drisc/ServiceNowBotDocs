# Sentiment analysis for surveys

You can use sentiment analysis to determine whether user responses for a survey are considered positive, negative, or neutral.

Activate the Sentiment Analysis \(com.snc.sentiment\_analysis\) plugin.

For a survey, you can select questions that should be used for analysis. The survey responses of these questions are sent to the thirdparty platforms for analysis through the specified connector configurations.

**Note:** You can only use string type questions for sentiment analysis.

The sentiment analysis results are displayed under **Survey** &gt; **Question Sentiment Results**. The sentiment label is based on the normalized score:

|Normalized score|Sentiment label|
|----------------|---------------|
|-1 to 0|Negative|
|0|Neutral|
|0 to 1|Positive|

-   **[Configure a sentiment connector](../task/configure-sentiment-connector.md)**  
Specify the service URL and other configuration information for third party APIs that are used for sentiment analysis.
-   **[Sentiment analysis property](../reference/sentiment-analysis-properties.md)**  
You can use the sentiment analysis property to customize the **Sentiment Analysis** module.
-   **[Sentiment analysis results](../reference/sentiment-analysis-results.md)**  
The sentiment analysis results view contains a bar chart that displays the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral results, along with the instance count for each category.
