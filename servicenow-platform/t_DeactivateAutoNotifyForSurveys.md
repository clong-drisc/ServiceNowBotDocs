# Deactivate auto-notification for surveys

Deactivate an auto-notification to avoid a problem that causes a second system-generated email notification being sent to a user.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin or survey\_admin

## About this task

When a survey is assigned to a user, an email notification containing a general survey URL is sent to the user. But sometimes, the user might receive a second system-generated notification.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Notification** &gt; **Email** &gt; **Notifications**.

2.  Open the **Survey Invitation** notification.

3.  Configure the form to add the **Send to event creator** option to the Who will receive section.

    The **Send to event creator** option is selected by default.

4.  Clear the **Send to event creator** check box.

    The system no longer sends auto-notification messages to survey users.
