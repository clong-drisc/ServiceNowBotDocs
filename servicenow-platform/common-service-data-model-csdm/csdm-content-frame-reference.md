# CSDM reference

Reference topics provide detailed descriptions of tables, properties, forms, and roles that are used in the CSDM framework.

## Basics

[CSDM terms](../reference/csdm-term-definitions.md)

[CI relationships in the CSDM](ci-relationships.md)

[How CSDM concepts map to CMDB tables](csdm-to-cmdb-mapping.md)

## Life cycles

[Document life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-document.md)

[Hardware life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-hardware.md)

[Location life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-location.md)

[Logical life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-logical.md)

[Product life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-product.md)

-   **[CSDM terms](../reference/csdm-term-definitions.md)**  
Most ServiceNow products and ServiceNow AI Platform applications align closely with the Common Service Data Model. This table defines terms as they are used across the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   **[CSDM life-cycle terms](../../configuration-management/reference/csdm-life-cyle-terms.md)**  
Most ServiceNow products and ServiceNow AI Platform applications align closely with the Common Service Data Model. This table defines terms as they are used across the ServiceNow AI Platform.
-   **[How CSDM concepts map to CMDB tables](csdm-to-cmdb-mapping.md)**  
The objects in the conceptual CSDM framework must map to the physical model objects \(CIs and CI class tables\) in the CMDB.
-   **[CI relationships in the CSDM](ci-relationships.md)**  
For configuration management to be most effective, establish relationships between the objects and configuration items \(CIs\) in the conceptual CSDM.
-   **[Life cycle value definitions for product entities](../reference/csdm-lifecycle-df-product.md)**  
The Life Cycle Stage and Life Cycle Stage Status values for the product life-cycle process are visible only in Product \(Models\) tables.
-   **[Life cycle value definitions for tangible/physical entities](../reference/csdm-lifecycle-df-tangible-physical.md)**  
The Life Cycle Stage and Life Cycle Stage Status values for the tangible/physical life-cycle process are visible only in Asset and CMDB tables for tangible/physical models and assets.
-   **[Life cycle value definitions for intangible/logical entities](../reference/csdm-lifecycle-df-intangible-logical.md)**  
The Life Cycle Stage and Life Cycle Stage Status values for the intangible/logical life-cycle process are visible in tables related to logical entities in Asset, IBI, and CMDB.
-   **[Life cycle value definitions for document and contract entities](../reference/csdm-lifecycle-df-document.md)**  
The Life Cycle Stage and Life Cycle Stage Status values for the document and contract life-cycle process are visible only in tables related to document entities in Contracts and CMDB.
-   **[Life cycle value definitions for location entities](../reference/csdm-lifecycle-df-location.md)**  
The values for the location life-cycle process reflect the locations used by your organization and are visible only in the common data locations table.
-   **[How life-cycle values for Asset, CI, and IBI are synced](../reference/cmdb-asset-CI-IBI-sync-options.md)**  
Your organization gains significant value from your ServiceNow AI Platform applications when you take advantage of the option to directly map legacy status values to CSDM **life cycle stage** and **life cycle stage status** values and auto-sync the values going forward.
-   **['Foundation' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard](../reference/csdm-datafdn-dash-foundation-tab.md)**  
Foundation domain reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard
-   **['Crawl' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard](../reference/csdm-datafdn-dash-crawl-tab.md)**  
Crawl stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard
-   **['Walk' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard](../reference/csdm-datafdn-dash-walk-tab.md)**  
Walk stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard
-   **['Run' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard](../reference/csdm-datafdn-dash-run-tab.md)**  
Run stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard
-   **['Fly' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard](../reference/csdm-datafdn-dash-fly-tab.md)**  
Fly stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard
-   **[Document life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-document.md)**  
The CSDM framework provides standard fields and values that you can use to track the life cycle of an asset or a CI. The document life-cycle value pairs represent the overall life cycle of document assets \(contracts\) and CIs \(business process\) as related to their products.
-   **[Hardware life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-hardware.md)**  
The CSDM framework provides standard fields and values that you can use to track the life cycle of an asset or a CI. The hardware life-cycle states represent the overall life cycle of hardware assets and CIs as related to their products.
-   **[Location life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-location.md)**  
The CSDM framework provides standard fields and values that you can use to track the life cycle of an asset or a CI. The location life-cycle value pairs represent the overall life cycle of a location within common data.
-   **[Logical life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-logical.md)**  
The CSDM framework provides standard fields and values that you can use to track the life cycle of an asset or a CI. The logical life-cycle value pairs represent the overall life cycle of logical assets and CIs as related to their products.
-   **[Product life cycle](csdm-lifecycle-product.md)**  
The CSDM framework provides standard fields and values that you can use to track the life cycle of an asset or a CI. The product life-cycle value pairs represent the overall life cycle of a product model, a specific version, or a product configuration.
-   **[Life cycle mapping form](../../configuration-management/reference/csdm-life-cycle-mapping-form.md)**  
Use the Life Cycle Mapping module to specify how existing legacy status values should be converted to CSDM life-cycle value pairs \(**life cycle stage** and **life cycle stage status**\). You map both asset and CI legacy status values to life-cycle value pairs.
