# 'Foundation' stage reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard

Foundation domain reports on the CSDM Data Foundations dashboard

## Reports on the Foundation tab

In this example, a report on the **Foundation** tab indicates that most named product models don't have associate product owners. Without this data, you might not be able, for example, to identify products that are reaching end-of-life. For details, see [Products and product models](../concept/foundation-domain.md#section-product-models).

-   **CSDM Foundation Indicators report**
    -   The **Priority** value is the product of the weight of the metric and the severity of the actual score. Priority ranges from 1 — Critical \(the highest priority\), to 5 — Low \(the lowest priority\).
    -   The **Result** column displays a color-coded bar showing the percentage of CIs or the measured item that are in compliance for the key foundational metric.

        -   Red: 0–50% are in compliance.
        -   Yellow: 50–90% are in compliance.
        -   Green: More than 90% are in compliance.
        To ensure optimum performance, the system stops collecting data for some metrics when they reach a specified number of non-compliant CIs. For information on managing data collection for a metric that isn't needed or that affects performance of the dashboard, see [Manage performance](../../configuration-management/concept/csdm-cmdb-foundations-dashboards.md#section-manage-performance).

    -   The **Remediation playbook URL** column displays links to knowledge articles in Now Support with instructions for bringing the CIs into compliance. Use your Now Support credentials to access the knowledge article.

To view detailed information on the impact of a metric and for details on working on issues, select the appropriate **Remediation playbook URL**.

-   **Named product models without product**

    For details, see [Products and product models](../concept/foundation-domain.md#section-product-models).

-   **Locations without parents**

    You can create a hierarchy of location data using the Parent attribute to match your reporting requirements. Missing parent locations break the structure. See [Location table \[cmn\_location\]](../concept/csdm-implement-foundation-stage.md#dlentry-location-table).

-   **Business units without companies**

    The hierarchy of your business is populated in the Business Unit table with a reference to the parent company. A business unit is a part of your organization that is responsible for specific operations, such as finance, human resources \(HR\), or IT. A hierarchy within a business unit is common. For large multinational organizations, you may have business units that identify independent regional operations and the specific operations within the region.
