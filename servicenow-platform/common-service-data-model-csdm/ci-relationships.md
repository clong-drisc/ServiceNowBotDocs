# CI relationships in the CSDM

For configuration management to be most effective, establish relationships between the objects and configuration items \(CIs\) in the conceptual CSDM.

## Required CSDM relationships

-   Most features and products, such as the Technology Portfolio Management risk assessment and Application Portfolio Management \(APM\), depend on the relationships.
-   The relationships commonly created as part of Service Mapping and Discovery are the standard for infrastructure CIs. If you map the elements manually, be sure to consider how Discovery would have treated them.
-   Not all objects in the CSDM conceptual model are CMDB tables, and not all the objects have relationships. You might need to create some of the following required relationships.

**Note:** Business services and technology management services connect to the spm\_service\_portfolio through the spm\_taxonomy\_node. See [Service Portfolio Management taxonomy](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=SPM2-taxonomy&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-it-service-management&ft:locale=en-US).
