# Edit a question in Catalog Builder

Edit an existing question if you want to improve it by adding dynamic form behavior.

## Before you begin

Role required: catalog\_builder\_editor, catalog\_admin, or admin

## About this task

Set values for the fields and condition-based field messages. Make the question mandatory, visible, or read-only based on your requirements. You can also deactivate the question.

You can’t edit the questions that belong to single-row and multi-row variable sets.

-   If the question is used in a published catalog item, you can’t delete it but you can mark it as inactive. You can include such questions again in the catalog item by using the **Insert De-activated questions** option.
-   Removing a new question that has never been published deletes the question.
-   You can’t remove questions of types that aren't allowed in the template or supported in the Catalog Builder.
