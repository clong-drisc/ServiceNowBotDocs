# Service Catalog terms and roles

The Service Catalog application uses these roles to manage different aspects of the application.

## Service Catalog terms

-   **Execution Plans**

    Define how something gets delivered. For example, a PDA could go through procurement / activation / and installation of the desktop software.

-   **Execution Plan Tasks**

    Plan Tasks represent a step in the Execution Plan, are associated with a Fulfillment Group, and have an approximate duration.

-   **Fulfillment Groups**

    Fulfillment Groups work execution tasks. For example, one group can activate a cell phone while a different group installs the desktop software.

-   **Tickets**

    Tickets represent work done by Fulfillment Groups as part of an Execution Plan.
