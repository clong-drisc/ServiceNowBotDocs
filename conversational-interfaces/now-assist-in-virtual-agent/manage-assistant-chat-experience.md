## Procedure

1.  Select the **Chat experience** page.

2.  In the **Messages** section, set up your greeting topic, closing topic, error topic, and survey.

    Selecting a default topic shows its corresponding default message. You can also create your own topic from **All** &gt; **Assistant Designer** &gt; **Asset Library**, and use it as the greeting or closing topic. When selecting a custom topic, the message field isn’t shown in the preview pane.

    Closing message only appears if you have a display experience with standard chat.
