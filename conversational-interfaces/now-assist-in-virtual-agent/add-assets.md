# Add assets to a chat assistant

Map an asset to an assistant. Assets are the building blocks of each assistant, providing them with instructions and functionality for helping users.

## Before you begin

See [Add a Knowledge Graph schema to a chat assistant](add-kg-schema-assistant.md).

Role required: virtual\_agent\_admin or admin

## About this task

Assets are LLM-powered components that admins can create to define all issues that the assistant could be equipped to solve.

When viewing or editing an existing assistant, you can view or edit the assets that are associated with an assistant. Assets can also be added to an assistant from the Asset Library and/or Topic Migration.

**Note:** If you're an existing customer who previously turned on or off a skill type for an existing assistant, you can add or remove any individual asset when editing an assistant.

## Procedure

1.  Select **Add assets**.

    By default, no assets are mapped to the assistant.

    The **Add assets from library** modal appears where you can multi-select assets that you want to assign to the assistant. Asset types include:

    -   Topics
    -   Subflows
    -   Actions
    -   Custom skills
    -   AI agents
    **Note:** For Now Assist panel - Developer assistant, only topics are available.

    ![Select assets from library.](../image/NAinVA-select-assets-122025.png "Select assets from library")

2.  Select **Save**.

    The list view appears where you can manage assets that are associated with an assistant. The table is not editable from this view. To further edit the assets, navigate to the assistant edit flow.

    To unmap an asset, select **Manage assets** and uncheck the desired asset.

3.  Select **Save and continue**.
