# Legacy - Overview tab

Use the Overview tab to get a snapshot of some of the information collected in the Conversational Analytics dashboard.

**Important:**

Conversational Analytics dashboard is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be supported until deprecation but will no longer be available for installation. A new Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience, which meets the compliance requirements of Government Community Cloud \(GCC\), and thus FedRAMP authorized, is available. See [Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience](VA-dashboard-landing-page-pae.md).

For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

If you are an existing user of this dashboard and want to migrate analytics data to the new dashboard, see [Migrate data to Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience \[KB1651556\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1651556).

The **Overview** tab is the landing page for the dashboard. It provides a summary of the information on all the other dashboard tabs. To use the **Overview** tab, you must have the Chat Analytics Viewer \(chat\_analytics\_viewer\) role.

**Note:** Now Assist in Virtual Agent Analytics appears in the left navigation only when you have Now Assist in Virtual Agent enabled.
