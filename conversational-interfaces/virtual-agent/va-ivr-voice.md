# Integrating Virtual Agent with Conversational IVR

ServiceNow's Conversational IVR with Amazon Connect enables Conversational Interactive Voice Response \(IVR\) to be conducted by your instance. Users will be able to conduct conversations with a bot via the phone channel, powered by ServiceNow Virtual Agent. Conversational IVR with Amazon Connect is available with the installation of Conversational IVR with Amazon Connect \(com.sn.va.amz.connect\) plugin.

Enable your users to initiate an IVR \(Interactive Voice Response\) conversation with your Virtual Agent Agent by building an integration with Amazon Connect. Using the Conversational IVR with Amazon Connect, you can enable a user to have a voice-based conversation with your Virtual Agent using Amazon Connect to help provide this functionality. This integration also provides the user the flexibility to connect with an agent using ServiceNow AWA Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) over SoftPhone.

## Conversational IVR highlights

-   Use Virtual Agent topics as a Conversational IVR to enable deflection in Phone channels, providing consistent end-user experience.
-   Enable true-omnichannel flow including routing Phone to the Conversational VA-IVR.
-   In case of escalations, route calls smoothly to live agents using AWA via conversational infrastructure.
