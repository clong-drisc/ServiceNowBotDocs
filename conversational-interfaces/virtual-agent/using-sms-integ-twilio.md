# Using Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio

Enable a requester to converse with an agent using the SMS conversations.

An administrator can configure the Conversational SMS Integration with Twilio application for integrating the SMS messaging app with a ServiceNow application.

A requester can initiate SMS conversations with a virtual agent or live agent.

A live agent can:

-   Accept SMS conversations as work items from their Agent Workspace Inbox to converse with a requester.
-   Initiate SMS chat conversations from interactions of type Chat from their Agent Workspace Inbox to converse with a requester.
-   For logged in customers, the system automatically identifies the customer by matching their phone number against the customer contact.

## Accepting SMS conversations

As a live agent interacting with a requester over the SMS service channel, you can:

-   Converse with the requester through text messages.
-   Share a knowledge article displayed as a link to the requester.
-   Share a record, for example, a customer service case.
-   Share any URLs as links.
-   Share any images as attachments.

**Note:** You accept a work item from the SMS conversation in your Agent Workspace Inbox when an administrator has configured the SMS service channel for transfer of chat conversations.

## Initiating SMS conversations

As a live agent, you can initiate an SMS conversation with a requester when the Agent-Initiated Messaging Interface application is configured for the SMS messaging channel. By default, the application is configured for agent to initiate SMS conversations with consumers and customer contacts.
