# Legacy - Use filters in the Conversation tab

You can filter out conversation for a deeper understanding.

**Important:**

Conversational Analytics dashboard is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be supported until deprecation but will no longer be available for installation. A new Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience, which meets the compliance requirements of Government Community Cloud \(GCC\), and thus FedRAMP authorized, is available. See [Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience](VA-dashboard-landing-page-pae.md).

For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

If you are an existing user of this dashboard and want to migrate analytics data to the new dashboard, see [Migrate data to Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience \[KB1651556\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1651556).

## Filtering using list options

You use the list options to filter the conversations.

**Note:** The dashboard converts the dates to UTC, which might not match the dates in the conversations list.

|Option|Description|
|------|-----------|
|All|Lists all conversations.|
|VA Success|List all conversations that are considered successful. You can edit the default formula that defines successful conversations by using formula overrides. For more information, see [Legacy - Create custom override definitions](../task/set-up-custom-definitions.md). In the base system, the default formula is set as a percentage of conversations that did not escalate to a live agent, did not have negative feedback, and contained a topic that went through to the last node.|
|Fallback|Lists all conversations where Virtual Agent didn't understand the user and used fallback text to prompt the user for additional information.|
|Live Agent Transfer|Lists all conversations where Virtual Agent transferred the user to a live agent.|

## Filtering using the Filter Editor

To filter the conversations, select **View/edit filter** and use the condition builder in the Filter Editor pop-up window. You can either select a default filter from the list or create a new filter condition. For example, the following image shows a condition in the Filter Editor pop-up window. This condition lists conversations that use the **Pizza Order** topic, and that have the **Pizza Type** topic node \(a static choice control\) in which the user has selected the **Pepperoni** value.

![Filter Editor showing static choice values. Conditions are defined for a Standard Topic containing Pizza Order, Topic Node containing Pizza Type, and Selected Value of Pepperoni.](../images/filter-cond.png "Condition using a static choice value")

Another example condition is shown in the following image. This condition lists conversations that use the **Pizza Order** topic and that have the **Confirm** topic node \(a boolean control\) in which the user has selected the **true** value.

![Filter Editor showing Boolean values. Conditions are defined for a Pizza Order standard topic, with Topic Node containing Confirm, and Selected Value of true.](../images/confirm-va.png "Condition using a boolean value")

The condition builder consists of the following:

-   Field: A list based on relevant tables. For more information about the field options, see [Field options in the Filter Editor](conversation-tab-filtering.md#section_zpm_12c_xpb).
-   Operator: A list of operators that is contextually generated based on the selected field.
-   Value: A text entry field or a list that is contextually generated based on the selected field.

To add a dependent condition in the condition builder, either select **or** or **and**. To filter the conversations list using the condition, select **Run**.

To remove a condition, select the delete icon ![Delete icon.](../images/delete-icon.png) next to the condition.

To save a condition that you created in the condition builder, select **Save Filter**. In the Save Filter pop-up window, specify a name for the condition. Users having the Chat Analytics Viewer \(chat\_analytics\_viewer\) role can select and modify your saved filters.
