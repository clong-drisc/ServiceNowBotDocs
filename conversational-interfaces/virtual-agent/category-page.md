# Legacy - Topic categories

Use the Category page in the Conversational Analytics dashboard to see the performance of Virtual Agent \(VA\) topics divided into categories.

**Important:**

Conversational Analytics dashboard is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be supported until deprecation but will no longer be available for installation. A new Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience, which meets the compliance requirements of Government Community Cloud \(GCC\), and thus FedRAMP authorized, is available. See [Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience](VA-dashboard-landing-page-pae.md).

For details on the deprecation process, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

If you are an existing user of this dashboard and want to migrate analytics data to the new dashboard, see [Migrate data to Conversational Analytics dashboard in Platform Analytics experience \[KB1651556\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1651556).

Topic categories group related conversation topics. Topics can belong to more than one category. Select the drop-down list to show the categories that you can display in the visualizations. The visualizations show the aggregate performance of Virtual Agent conversations that ran in the topics belonging to a category.
