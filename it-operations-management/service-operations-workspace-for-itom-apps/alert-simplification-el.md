# View an alert analysis by Now Assist in Express List

View an alert analysis created by ServiceNow® Now Assist using generative AI. Alert analyses include a human-readable brief of the alert and technical information to help you investigate the alert more effectively.

## Before you begin

-   Install the ITOM plugin in the Now Assist feature. For more information, see [Install the Now Assist for IT Operations Management \(ITOM\) plugin](../../now-assist-itom/task/install-now-assist-itom.md).
