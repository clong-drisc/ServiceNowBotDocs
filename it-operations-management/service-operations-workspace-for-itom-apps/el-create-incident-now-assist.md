# Create an incident with Now Assist in Express List

Create an incident with a human-readable, AI-generated description using Now Assist.

## Before you begin

Currently, this feature is available for CMDB, Log Analytics, tag-based, and component-based alerts.

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator, evt\_mgmt\_admin

**Note:** The evt\_mgmt\_user role is view-only and does not have permission to perform this action.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  Select the Express List icon \(![Express List icon.](../../event-management/image/express-list1.png)\) in the left navigation bar.

3.  Create an incident from a selected alert.

    1.  In the Express List pane, select the alert.

        **Note:** To display the individual alerts inside a group, select the chevron icon \(![Chevron icon.](../image/icon-chevron.png)\) at the beginning of the alert group row.

    2.  From the **Close** drop-down list, under Remediation actions, select **Create Incident with Now Assist**.

    An incident with a human-readable, AI-generated description is created from the selected alert and a confirmation message is displayed.

4.  View the created incident by selecting **View incident** in the confirmation message or on the alert preview panel.
