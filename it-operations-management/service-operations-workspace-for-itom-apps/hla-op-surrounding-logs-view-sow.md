# Analyze log lines that surround an anomaly

View the log lines around an anomaly to help you identify the root cause of a Log Analytics alert.

## Before you begin

Role required: evt\_mgmt\_operator or evt\_mgmt\_admin

## Procedure

1.  In the Service Operations Workspace, open a Log Analytics alert.

2.  Select the **Surrounding logs** tab and review the information.

    The tab displays the list of log lines that were generated one minute before and one second after the Log Analytics alert. For an explanation of the information on the tab, see [Surrounding logs tab fields](../reference/hla-surrounding-logs-tab.md).

3.  View a different timespan of the log lines using one of the following methods:

    -   Update the time range relative to the alert to a predefined time range in the **Select range** list.
    -   Specify a **Start time** or **End time** using the time picker.
4.  View the anomalous log data graphically as a function of time by selecting **Log viewer**.

    For more information, see [Reviewing the logs for an alert on the Log viewer](../concept/hla-op-logs-log-viewer-concept-sow.md).
