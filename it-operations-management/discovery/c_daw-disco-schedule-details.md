# Discovery Admin Workspace schedule details

Discovery Admin Workspace enables you to view, edit, and run IP-based Discovery schedules conveniently within a single interface.

To access Discovery schedule details in Discovery Admin Workspace, navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Discovery Admin Workspace** &gt; **Schedules** &gt; **Discovery schedules**.

**Note:** The capabilities described here are available in Discovery Admin Workspace v1.8.0 or later. Specific version requirements are noted for individual features where applicable.

After selecting a schedule name from the table, the schedule header displays key information such as Discovery details, MID Server details, and anomaly severity.

**Important:** Anomaly information displays only when anomaly detection is enabled. For more information, see [Discovery Admin Workspace Settings](discovery-admin-workspace-setup.md).

These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of the schedule's performance and status, showing key metrics like the number of discoveries completed, success rate, and any errors encountered. Additionally, the visualizations highlight trends over time, enabling you to quickly identify patterns and potential issues. For a full list of the visualizations available on this tab, see [Discovery Admin Workspace data visualizations](../reference/r_dawScheduleDetailsOverview.md).
