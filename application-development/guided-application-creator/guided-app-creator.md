# Guided Application Creator

Guided Application Creator is an intuitive development interface for building applications on the ServiceNow AI Platform®. It provides a step-by-step process to guide you through your initial application construction.

**Important:** You've landed at a legacy app creation tool that will be supported until the Australia release in Q1 2026. Try building and editing apps in the new version of ServiceNow Studio instead. For more information, see [Building applications with ServiceNow Studio](../../servicenow-studio/concept/servicenow-studio-landing.md).

## Using Guided Application Creator

Setting up an application in Guided Application Creator involves:

-   Creating an application record
-   Defining user roles
-   Designating data tables
-   Designing the application for different user experiences

You can also use Guided Application Creator to create an application record and then configure it in Studio later. For more information, see [Create an application record in Guided Application Creator](../task/gac-create-app-record.md).

## User experiences

When you set up an application in Guided Application Creator, you can make your application available in the following user experiences.

<table id="table_p4k_ygk_vhb"><thead><tr><th>

</table>## Guided Application Creator and the application creation process

Setting up an application in Guided Application Creator does not capture the entire process of creating an application. It is just one step of the process. Before you set up an application in Guided Application Creator, plan what kind of application you need for your business requirements before you build it.

After you set up an application in Guided Application Creator, you can further develop the application using [Studio](../../applications/concept/c_ServiceNowStudio.md), [Flows in Workflow Studio](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-flows&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-build-workflows&ft:locale=en-US), and [Team Development](../../team-development/concept/c_TeamDevelopment.md). After the application is fully built, you can test the application and then share the application with your users.

For more information on the application creation process, see [Building applications](../../custom-application/concept/build-applications.md).

## Activation information

Guided Application Creator is enabled via the Guided Application Creator \(com.glide.sn-guided-app-creator\) plugin, which is active by default in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

To work in Guided Application Creator, use a different browser. For more detail on Internet Explorer 11 support, see [KB0683275](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0683275).
