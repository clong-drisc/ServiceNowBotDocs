# App Engine for ERP with the ServiceNow AI Platform

Read and update your legacy ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system using Zero Copy Connector for ERP and identify customizations with ERP Semantic Mining \(ERP-CM\). You can then use additional ServiceNow AI Platform apps, such as App Engine Studio \(AES\), to organize and replatform ERP data.

Replatforming is the process of scanning legacy ERP system code to find potential candidates to move onto your ServiceNow AI Platform instance as new apps. You can use data from the ERP system as a source for apps built on the ServiceNow AI Platform, improving performance, enhancing security, and reducing maintenance.

## Combined benefits of integrating Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP-CM to replatform apps

Legacy systems of records, such as SAP, can have old, complex custom code and data that require more time and effort to move to newer versions of the system of record. Use Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP Semantic Mining \(ERP-CM\) to scan the system of record to find and replace custom code with digitized workflows, resulting in a clean ERP core.

![ERP Semantic Mining diagnoses your ERP system to identify customizations and recommend next steps in replatforming the apps to the ServiceNow AI Platform.](../../build/erp-customization-mining/image/erpcm-landing-page-infographic.png "ERP Semantic Mining and App Engine for ERP")

The replatforming of legacy code enables innovation on top of the system of record without knowledge of the legacy system. Database administrators and developers are then relieved of time-consuming efforts to create database views or endpoints in the system of record, freeing them to work on other projects, such as migration.

Replatformed data is immediately available, mirrored in easy-to-manage tables and apps. Users no longer need to request information from database administrators, which can take weeks. Replatformed apps use the ERP system of record as the live data source.

## Workflow for Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP-CM

Using Zero Copy Connector for ERP and ERP-CM together enables Solutions Integration consultants to implement the following workflow:

1.  Have your administrator use the Connections and Credentials app to configure credentials to connect Zero Copy Connector for ERP to the ERP system of record. For more information, see [Connections and Credentials](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r-credentials&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-security&ft:locale=en-US).
2.  Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP using the connection and credentials alias that you configured. For more information, see [Create an ERP system in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/task/create-an-erp-system.md).
3.  In Zero Copy Connector for ERP, build your ERP systems, ERP models, and tables in a development instance.
    1.  Create or clone an ERP model that scans the specified ERP module in the system of record for available tables and fields. Note the tables and fields in the ERP model for use in extraction and remote tables. For more information, see [Clone an ERP model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/task/erp-canvas-clone-data-model.md).
    2.  Add new tables, fields, and table joins to include additional data in the ERP model. For more information, see the following topics:
        -   [Managing how models read and update the ERP system](../../build/erp-integration/concept/erpc-managing-models-read.md)
        -   [Add joins between ERP tables](../../build/erp-integration/task/erp-canvas-add-join-data-model.md)
    3.  Create update operation using a BAPI \(Business Application Programming Interface\) to update data on the ERP system as needed.
    4.  Build and customize remote tables to make them available for use as a data source, such as when building apps in App Engine Studio. Remote tables get their records from running an associated script against an external data source. For more information, see:
        -   [View and edit ERP remote table details with Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/task/erpi-find-tables.md)
        -   [Customize fields for an ERP remote table in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/task/erp-canvas-build-remote-table.md)
        -   [Query a remote table using Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/task/erp-canvas-query-remote-table.md)
    5.  Work with ETL extraction tables to regularly scan the system of record and extract data to a staging table. Extraction tables retrieve large amounts of data using a scheduled query, and use transform tables to process data for use on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
        -   Create as many separate extraction tables as needed, such as one for each supported country. For more information, see [Extracting and transforming data in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/concept/erp-canvas-extraction-tables.md).
        -   You must first create the table transform map that connects the source table \(on the system of record\) to a Glide table on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information on creating table transform maps, see [Create a transform map](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateATransformMap&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-integrate-applications&ft:locale=en-US).
        -   Extraction processes are configured in the ServiceNow app that uses them. For example, Workflow Studio.
        -   After the extraction process is run, use import sets to map imported data into ServiceNow AI Platform tables. For more information, see [Import sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=import-sets-landing-page&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-integrate-applications&ft:locale=en-US).
4.  Identify legacy ERP system customizations to modernize and replatform with ERP-CM.
5.  Move the Zero Copy Connector for ERP systems, ERP models, and tables to a production environment when they are ready. For more information, see [Managing ERP development pipelines in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/concept/manage-erp-tables-pipelines.md).
    1.  Meet with a customer and agree to run an analysis with ERP Semantic Mining on their ERP system of record.
    2.  Connect the customer ERP system of record to the ServiceNow instance using Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

        **Note:** Most customers have their own instance.

        ERP-CM uses the system connections configured in Zero Copy Connector for ERP. For more information, see [Working with ERP systems in Zero Copy Connector for ERP](../../build/erp-integration/concept/erp-canvas-work-with-systems.md).

    3.  Use Zero Copy Connector for ERP to build ERP models from fields on the available remote tables as specified in previous workflow steps.
    4.  Run ERP Semantic Mining to find candidates. Candidates are custom code in the system of record that you can replace with ServiceNow apps. For more information, see [Browse an overview of candidates in ERP-CM](../../build/erp-customization-mining/task/erpcm-view-home-page-overview.md).
    5.  Choose candidates to replatform. For more information, see [Save potential candidates to replatform](../../build/erp-customization-mining/task/erpcm-find-candidates.md).
    6.  Use the candidate details in ERP-CM as a central place to enter comments and save attachments relating to the candidate. For more information, see [View and work with candidate details in ERP-CM](../../build/erp-customization-mining/task/erpcm-view-work-with-candidate-details.md).
    7.  In the candidate details, identify any similar candidates that you could combine into a single replatformed app. For more information, see [How ERP Semantic Mining determines candidate score and potential](../../build/erp-customization-mining/concept/erpcm-potential-and-recommendations.md).
    8.  Return to Zero Copy Connector for ERP to continue building data models with remote tables and extraction tables. Ensure that all the necessary data is available in the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [Building and managing ERP models to work with ERP data](../../build/erp-integration/concept/work-with-erp-data-models.md).
6.  Use the ERP data that is now available as the data source when building apps on the ServiceNow AI Platform, such as:
    -   App Engine Studio: For more information, see [Create a data model for your application](../../build/app-engine-studio/concept/add-data.md).
    -   Flows in Workflow Studio: For more information, see [Configuring flows](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-flow-designer&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-build-workflows&ft:locale=en-US).
