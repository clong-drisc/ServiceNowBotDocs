# ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel taxonomy

Learn more about each metadata file type and its corresponding primary table in the File categories tab of the ServiceNow Studio Navigator panel.

**Note:** Any additional extensions of the sys\_metadata table are automatically included in the Navigator panel in the appropriate section.

For each file category, see the file types that you can create and their corresponding primary table. For more information about navigating to a file's primary table, see [Navigate directly to a table in ServiceNow Studio](../task/qs-navigate-directly-to-table.md).

## Automation files

Automations provide ways to manage recurring tasks efficiently, with fewer steps, reducing human input and effort. For example, you can configure an email notification to be sent automatically when a record is approved. Create automations to streamline and simplify how you work by adding automations to an app, such as actions, flows, and other automatic tasks.

Action

</td><td>

Actions automate a repeatable task or operation within a flow as a sequence of related steps. Actions run a sequence of steps to complete the task, and pass data to the flow as outputs.

Use assignment data lookups to assign a record automatically using Data Lookup and Record Matching. For example, you can automatically set a value in the assigned\_to and assignment\_group fields for a record when a set of conditions occurs, such as assigning approvals to a group of managers for users below a certain level.

Client Extension Instance

</td><td>

Use a client extension integration to a registered instance of a client extension point that links a UI script with a client extension point. The UI script is included on pages that invoke the client extension point.

Client Extension Point

</td><td>

Client extension points extend the functionality of an application without altering the original application code. Extension points can help prevent your custom code interactions from breaking, which often occurs after an upgrade if you directly embed the custom code into the application code.

 For more information, see [Using extension points to extend application functionality](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=extension-points&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-api-reference&ft:locale=en-US).

UI Extension Instance

</td><td>

Use a UI extension instance to create a registered instance of a UI extension point that links a UI macro with a UI extension point. The macro can be called whenever the UI extension point is invoked.

 For more information, see [Creating and adding a UI extension point](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=impl-ui-ext-pts-base-code&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-api-reference&ft:locale=en-US).

UI Policy

</td><td>

UI policies dynamically change the behavior of information on a form and control custom process flows for tasks. For example, you can use UI policies to make the number field on a form read only, make the short description field required, and hide other fields.

 For more information, see [Using UI policies](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_CreateAUIPolicy&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US).

Natural Language Understanding \(NLU\) is a model that enables a computer to interpret, analyze, and derive meaning from human language.
