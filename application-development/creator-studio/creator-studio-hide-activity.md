# Make an activity unavailable in playbooks

Deactivate an activity to stop users from adding it to playbooks in Creator Studio.

## Before you begin

For example, you could hide an base system activity, like sending an email, if it's not relevant to your workflow.

**Note:** Hiding an activity doesn't change anything about the processes using that activity. Hiding an activity only makes it unavailable in Creator Studio.

Role required: admin or app\_engine\_admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Engine** &gt; **Request App Administration** &gt; **Creator Studio Activities**.

    All of the standard Creator Studio activities appear in the list, not just custom activities.

    The Creator Studio Activities table appears.
