# Update an ERP-CM connection

Update the Connections and Credentials alias for ERP Semantic Mining \(ERP-CM\) to change the connection to the ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system. For example, you may want to change from a non-production system to a production system.

## Before you begin

You should install Zero Copy Connector for ERP and add credentials there before you install and configure ERP-CM. For more information, see [Configure the Zero Copy Connector for ERP credentials and connection](../../erp-integration/task/set-up-erp-integration-connection.md).

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_admin, sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_admin

## About this task

**Warning:** Changing the system and credential alias deletes all existing data in the ERP-CM workspace and restarts the data integration process.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ERP Foundation** &gt; **ERP Customization Mining**.

2.  Select the connection status icon \(![Credential alias page link](../image/credential-alias-icon.png)\) in the side panel.

3.  Select the **Change system** button.

4.  In the **Change system &amp; delete data** box, choose the system you configured in Zero Copy Connector for ERP from the **Select system to change to** field.

5.  Confirm your choice by selecting the **Yes, I am sure I want to change system and delete data** option.

6.  Select the **Change and delete data** button.

    ERP-CM begins to delete current data and restarts the data integration process.

7.  Refresh the Issues to review list and the Executed tasks list by selecting their respective refresh icons \(![Refresh the Executed tasks list](../image/refresh-icon.png)\).
