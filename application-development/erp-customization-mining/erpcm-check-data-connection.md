# Check and troubleshoot the data refresh status for ERP Semantic Mining

Check the data refresh status to find out when ERP Semantic Mining \(ERP-CM\) most recently loaded ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) data from the system of record.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_admin and sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_user

## About this task

To verify that ServiceNow AI Platform® is synchronized with the ERP system of record, ServiceNow AI Platform reloads data every 24 hours from the system of record.

You can receive email notifications for connection task success and failures. For more information, see [Getting notifications for ERP Semantic Mining connection updates](../concept/erpcm-notifications.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ERP Foundation** &gt; **ERP Customization Mining**.

2.  In the side panel, select the connection status icon \(![Credential alias page link](../image/credential-alias-icon.png)\).

    The **Overview** tab displays a summary of connection issues to review, as well as a list of the most recent active connection tasks.

3.  Check the most important connection details in the **Connection status** page header.

    |Field|Definition|
    |-----|----------|
    |Credential alias|Alias of the connection credentials configured in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.|
    |Updated by|Name of the last account to update the connection credentials.|
    |ERP heartbeat|Indicates whether a ping to the connection is currently successful.|
    |Task execution|Indicates whether ServiceNow AI Platform® is currently attempting to connect to the instance.|

4.  View a refined subset of connection tasks by selecting one of the following tabs.

</table>5.  Troubleshoot any system connection issues using the **Change system** button.

    ![Troubleshoot the system connection using the Change system button.](../image/ecm-change-connection-ys2.png)

    -   Pause the task execution by selecting **Stop task execution**.
    -   Restart the ETL \(extract, transform, and load\) process by selecting **Retry ETL process**.
    -   Delete all data in ERP-CM and start over by selecting **Delete data**. On the confirmation dialog, you must select the **Yes, I am sure I want to delete data** option and select the **Delete data** button.

        **Warning:** This action deletes all existing data in the ERP-CM workspace and restarts the data integration process.

    -   Share and back up data at any time by selecting **Export data**. A downloadable zip file is created.
    -   After exporting data, use the created zip file **Import data** for sharing and back up.
    -   Use **Run AI/ML analysis** when making changes to existing models or importing completely new models, to ensure that the ML training in the mining process is based on the relevant data.
    -   Use **Reset AI/ML analysis** to reset the analysis so the flow can run again. This enables you to control the ML training in the mining process.
6.  View the information for each task and note actions that you must take by scrolling to the task list.

    For a description of the field values, see [ERP-CM task list field descriptions](../reference/erpcm-task-list-details.md).

    For any column, you can select the more options icon \(![More options icon](../../../administer/ui-builder/image/more-options-icon.png)\) to perform additional actions, such as **Show matching** and **Filter out**.

7.  Update the status of any open task in error to indicate changes to its status.

    You can't resolve errors directly in ERP-CM, but you can mark them as resolved or irrelevant.

    1.  Select the **Task** tab.

    2.  On the **Task** tab, select the task that you want to update.

    3.  Update the **Status** on the task record to **Resolved** or **Irrelevant**.

8.  Refresh the Issues to review list and the Executed tasks list by selecting their respective refresh icons \(![Refresh the Executed tasks list](../image/refresh-icon.png)\).
