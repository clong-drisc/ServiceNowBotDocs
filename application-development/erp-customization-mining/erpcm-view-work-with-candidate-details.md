# View and work with candidate details in ERP-CM

View and edit candidate details and recommended actions in ERP Semantic Mining \(ERP-CM\). Analyze ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) system scan results, linked ERP models, usage, and similar candidates.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_mining.erp\_user

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **ERP Foundation** &gt; **ERP Customization Mining**.

2.  In the side panel, select the candidates icon \(![Candidates icon](../image/erpcm-candidates-icon.png)\).

3.  View and edit the basic details for a candidate in a new tab within ERP-CM by selecting the candidate **Name** in the candidates list.

    Alternatively, you can select a candidate directly on the ERP-CM home page. For more information, see [Browse an overview of candidates in ERP-CM](erpcm-view-home-page-overview.md).

    The **Details** tab of the candidate is where you can review and update any basic details, as well as work with comments, attachments, and the Activity stream.

<table id="table_g5l_wp4_jyb"><thead><tr><th>

Field

</th><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Name

</td><td>

Record number of the potential candidate, which is automatically generated.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Status

</td><td>

Status of the candidate, either **Draft** or **Potential**.When you evaluate a draft candidate and decide the candidate is good to replatform, you can change the status from **Draft** to **Potential**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ERP application

</td><td>

Name of the ERP application on the ERP system.

</td></tr><tr><td>

ERP module

</td><td>

Functional business area of the ERP system, such as **Sales**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Short description

</td><td>

Brief description of the candidate, what the application does.

Long text

</td><td>

Additional information about the candidate.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>4.  Work with the next recommended steps by selecting the **Recommendations** tab.

    For more information, see [Check candidate recommendations in ERP-CM](erpcm-work-with-recommendations.md).

5.  View details on which tables were relevant to the candidate and the details of their scan on the ERP system by selecting the **ERP scan results** tab.

    For a description of the field values, see [ERP-CM candidate scan results field descriptions](../reference/erpcm-candidate-scan-results-descriptions.md).

    ![ERP-CM scan results](../image/erpcm-candidate-scan.png "Candidate scan results")

6.  Check and note which ERP models are ERP-CM identified as being related to the candidate by selecting the **Models** tab.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Model type|ERP model relevant to the candidate. This model can be a standard ERP model \(which you work with in Zero Copy Connector for ERP\), a workflow, or a custom business area.|
    |Relevant for implementation|Whether the ERP model is required for replatforming.|
    |Module|ERP business area for the model on the system of record, such as **Sales**.|
    |Table names|Names of the tables in the ERP model on the ERP system.|
    |Updated|Date and time the list was most recently updated.|

    You can note which ERP models to work with in Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

7.  Check the number of system users that use the candidate application by selecting the **Usage** tab.

8.  Research candidates related to the current candidate and their tables by selecting the **Similar candidates** tab.

    Similar candidates are helpful when planning how to best replatform a legacy app. When you replatform a custom app from the system of record, you don't have to replicate the old app exactly. Use the replatforming process to design a better app, perhaps one that addresses the needs of multiple similar candidates in a single, new app built using low-code tools on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

    For a description of the field values, see [ERP-CM similar candidates field descriptions](../reference/erpcm-similar-candidates-field-descriptions.md).

9.  Select the **Save** button and save any changes you made to the candidate details.


## What to do next

After you work with the candidate details and identify similar candidates, you can:

-   [Check candidate recommendations in ERP-CM](erpcm-work-with-recommendations.md).
-   [Save potential candidates to replatform](erpcm-find-candidates.md).
-   Continue building remote table and extraction tables in the relevant ERP model in Zero Copy Connector for ERP, making the data available on the ServiceNow AI Platform. For more information, see [Using ERP models, extraction tables, and remote tables](../../erp-integration/concept/work-with-erp-systems-connections-and-remote-tables.md).

**Note:**

If you delete a candidate from ERP-CM, it automatically reappears the next time the ERP system is scanned. Instead of deleting candidates, use the **Save as potential candidate** feature to organize your candidates.
