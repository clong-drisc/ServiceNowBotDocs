# View ERP extraction tables

Work with ETL \(extract, transform, and load\) processes in Zero Copy Connector for ERP to extract large amounts of ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) data from the ERP system. Extracted data is stored in Glide tables in the ServiceNow AI Platform.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_user

## About this task

ERP extraction tables extract and save data to a transform table on the ServiceNow AI Platform. The transform table is a temporary table that holds data during the data integration or transformation process. Transform tables are an intermediary step before data is further processed, cleaned, or loaded into the target destination.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the ERP extraction tables page by selecting the ERP extraction tables icon \(![ERP extraction tables navigation icon](../image/erpc-extraction-table-icon.png)\) in the side panel.

3.  View the list of ERP extraction tables and note the tables that you can use to build your ERP model.

</table>4.  View the details for an extraction table by selecting the table name.


## What to do next

After the extraction process is run, use import sets to map imported data into ServiceNow AI Platform tables. For more information, see [Import sets](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=import-sets-landing-page&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-integrate-applications&ft:locale=en-US).
