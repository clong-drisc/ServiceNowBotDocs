# Query a remote table using Zero Copy Connector for ERP

Query ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) remote tables from a system of record directly from the **All** menu using Zero Copy Connector for ERP.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_erp\_integration.erp\_user

## About this task

You can query the system of record to create an ERP model for your ERP processes. For more information, see [Building and managing ERP models to work with ERP data](../concept/work-with-erp-data-models.md).

**Note:** Zero Copy Connector for ERP doesn't replicate data into the ServiceNow AI Platform. It mirrors data that lives in the ERP system of record, and remains protected there.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP** &gt; **Zero Copy Connector for ERP Home**.

2.  Open the Remote tables page by selecting the remote tables icon \(![remote tables navigation icon](../image/erpc-remote-table-icon.png)\) in the side panel.

3.  Select the remote table from the navigation menu, such as **SAP Country**.

4.  Select **Open remote table list**.

5.  Query the remote table using Glide for SAP.

    For example, you can select and hold \(or right-click\) on a column, such as **Storage location**, and select **Show Matching** records.

    The SAP data is accessible for you to work with using standard ServiceNow AI Platform searching, sorting, and filtering, such as the condition builder. For more information, see [Condition builder](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ConditionBuilder&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-user-interface&ft:locale=en-US).
