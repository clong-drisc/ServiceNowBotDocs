# Contextual development edit messages

The platform displays a message if you attempt to edit a Store Application record when you're in a different application scope.

![](../image/ApplicationContextWarningMessage.png "Application context edit message")

This message can be used to:

-   Open the application to which the current configuration record belongs.
-   Open the application of the currently selected application in the application picker.
-   Temporarily switch to the application to which the current configuration record belongs and edit it.

**Note:** The system returns you to the current application context after you save or cancel out of the record.

The system also displays a message when a user attempts to configure a list or form layout while working from another application scope.

The message provides a list of valid options:

-   Edit the current section by temporarily switching to the application that owns it.
-   Create a new section in the current application context.
-   Create a new view in the current application context.

**Note:** The system returns you to the current application context after you save or cancel out of the record.
