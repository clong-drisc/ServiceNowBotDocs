# Exploring Build Agent

The Build Agent enables developers to create, edit, and deploy full-stack ServiceNow® applications that encompass both user interface and back-end components.

## Build Agent overview

The Build Agent is an AI tool designed for developers within the ServiceNow Integrated Development Environment \(ServiceNow IDE\). It functions as an autonomous AI agent capable of independently generating a complete ServiceNow® scoped application.

As a chat panel within the ServiceNow IDE, you can interact with the Build Agent through an easy-to-use multi-turn conversation interface.

You can simply describe your desired application in your natural language, and the agent can automatically create it. It is designed to generate the necessary code, organize files clearly, and manage both the core logic and user interface components of the application.

The Build Agent can understand natural language prompts, autonomously generate full-stack applications, oversee the entire build process, and respond to feedback.

You can also attach images, such as architectural diagrams or UI wireframes, to provide context for prompts in the Build Agent. This method enables you to convey the application design and functionality more effectively.

While creating and updating applications is the primary use case for the Build Agent, its capabilities extend beyond that. It can perform various code-related tasks, such as rewriting tables, explaining code, validating and enhancing existing applications, fixing application errors, and more. For instance, Build Agent can use the Run Query tool to query a specific table within your instance and return the top five records or derive specific insights.

**Important:** Build Agent only creates metadata supported by ServiceNow® Fluent. For more information, see [ServiceNow Fluent](../../servicenow-sdk/concept/servicenow-fluent.md).

## Build Agent \(Trial\) app overview

The Build Agent is also available as a trial app that operates on a freemium model. To install the Build Agent \(Trial\) app, visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://www.servicenow.com/products/vibe-coding.html#benefits).

After you install the Build Agent \(Trial\) app, your instance will receive 25 free user interactions for 30 days at no additional charge. This enables you to explore the Build Agent features at no additional cost.

However, if you exceed the limit of free interactions, you can either wait for your free interactions to reset after 30 days or install the paid Build Agent app on your instance to continue using its services. For more information on how to install Build Agent, see [Install Build Agent](../tasks/install-build-agent.md).

## Planning tool overview

The Build Agent includes a planning tool that creates a detailed, step-by-step plan for your application development. You can refine the plan iteratively by prompting for changes and providing feedback until you reach a final version. The tool emphasizes user control, enabling you to use prompts to request changes to the plan. Overall, it facilitates collaborative planning before proceeding with implementation.

## Build Agent benefits

Build Agent accelerates application development on the ServiceNow AI Platform. It helps automate many repetitive and time-consuming tasks that developers previously had to do manually, enabling:

-   Increased developer productivity
-   Reduced development backlogs
-   Quicker deployment of new business applications
-   Reduction in overall development cost
