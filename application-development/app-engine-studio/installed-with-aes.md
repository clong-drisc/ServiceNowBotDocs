</table>**Note:** The following data preservers are added for tables related to pipelines:

-   Environment
-   Pipeline
-   Pipeline Environment Order
-   Pipeline Types

The data preservers prevent records in these tables from being overwritten during cloning on a non-production instance. For more information, see [Create a clone preserver](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-new-clone-preserver&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-administration&ft:locale=en-US).
