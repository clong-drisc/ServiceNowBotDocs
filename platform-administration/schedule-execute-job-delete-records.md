# Schedule or execute a job to delete records

Schedule a date and time to execute a delete job or execute the job immediately.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

Consider scheduling the delete job to run during non-business hours to minimize the potential performance impact on your users. Deleting all records in a table temporarily locks the table, which prevents inserts and updates. If you want to delete all records from a table, use the table cleaner option instead. For more information, see [Deleting older or unwanted records](../concept/deleting-older-records.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **System Data Management** &gt; **Delete jobs**.

2.  Select a delete job record.

3.  Determine whether to schedule the delete job for a later time or run it right away.

2.  When prompted, select **Proceed** to delete the records now.
3.  On the Progress page, select **Cancel** to stop the job from continuing to run.
4.  Select **Check execution results** to return to the delete job form.
5.  In the **Deletion Counts** table, view the **Actual record count** column to see an updated count of deleted records from each table.
6.  Select the **View Rollback Context** link to review the changes.
