# Updating records safely

Update several records simultaneously without using scripts by creating and executing a batch update job.

## Overview of updating records safely

1.  [Mark records for updating](../task/mark-records-update.md)

    Determine which records to update by creating an update job. Preview the number of affected records before you schedule or execute the job. For example, you might want to update the Assigned to value for multiple incidents on a test instance without running a script.

2.  [Schedule or execute a job to update records](../task/schedule-execute-job-update-records.md)

    Schedule the job to run later or execute the job immediately.

3.  [Rollback an update job](../task/rollback-update-job.md)

    Use the rollback option in the update job if you need to restore the updated records to their previous state.
