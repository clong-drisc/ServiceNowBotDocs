# Advanced email setup

With an advanced email setup, you can use your own SMTP server, POP3 server, or both.

Setting up your own email environment can be useful if you want to use existing filtering, retention, or compliance aspects of your internal email architecture. You can set up email in several ways:

-   Use your own SMTP server to forward email to ServiceNow servers.
-   Use your own SMTP server to send email.
-   Use your own POP3 server to receive email.
-   Use your own SMTP and POP3 servers to send and receive email.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled SMTP server to send email from a third-party service.
-   Use an OAuth 2.0-enabled IMAP server to receive email from a third-party service.

The following procedures assume that you [enabled basic email properties](../task/t_ConfiguringStandardEmail.md).

-   **[Enable using your own SMTP server](../task/t_ConfAltEmailUsgOwnSMTP.md)**

Help prevent sending emails to addresses that are known to generate bounces by monitoring and filtering them out while sending emails.

OAuth enables your instance to receive and send email through a third-party email account.
