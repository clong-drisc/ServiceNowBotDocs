# Field settings for AI Search

A field setting controls indexing behavior for a specified field \(column\) on all records from an indexed source.

Examples of how you might use field settings include the following.

-   Disable text indexing or searchability for a field found on source table records
-   Modify default mappings between source table fields and fields in the AI Search index
-   Add a referenced table field to the index by dot-walking from a reference field on source table records

An indexed source's field settings appear in its Field Settings &amp; Mapping related list.

**Parent Topic:**[Indexed sources in AI Search](indexed-sources-ais.md)

## Create a field setting for an AI Search indexed source

Define an indexed source field setting to configure AI Search content indexing behavior for a specific field on source table records.

### Before you begin

Role required: ais\_admin

### About this task

For details on available field settings and values, see [List of AI Search indexed source field settings](field-settings-ais.md#).

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Index** &gt; **Indexed Sources**.

2.  Open the indexed source that you want to define a field setting for.

3.  In the Field Settings &amp; Mapping related list, select **New**.

4.  On [the Field Setting form](../reference/field-setting-form-ais.md), fill in the fields.

5.  Select **Submit**.


### Result

The new field setting appears in the Field Settings &amp; Mapping related list.

### What to do next

To make the new field setting take effect, perform a full table reindex for the indexed source. For details on this procedure, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

## Enable indexing of referenced table fields for an AI Search indexed source

Configure an indexed source to index field values from tables referenced by fields in the source table. You can index these field values for use in filters and EVAM search result configurations, index them for search, or both.

### Before you begin

You must have an indexed source configured for the source table. For details on creating an indexed source for a table, see [Create an indexed source](../task/create-indexed-source-ais.md).

Role required: ais\_admin

### About this task

When an indexed source table includes a reference field, AI Search defaults to indexing values for the reference field but not for other fields on the table that it references. To index values from these referenced table fields, you can create **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field settings on your indexed source table.

-   To use field values from referenced tables in search source filters, facet filters, and EVAM search result configurations, create a **dot\_walk\_fields** field setting.
-   To make field values from referenced tables searchable, create a **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field setting.

As the value for either of these field settings, list the names of the referenced table fields you want to index, separated by commas. For example, to index the **name** and **city** fields from the table referenced by the **company** field on the indexed source table, select the **company** field and enter value `name,city`.

To dot-walk across multiple tables, you can enter field name values with dot-separated reference field prefixes. For example, enter value `company.contact.name` to index the **name** field in the table referenced by the **contact** field on the table referenced by the indexed source table's **company** reference field.

**Note:** Each dot-walk reference level imposes a performance impact on indexing. Avoid using multi-level references unless necessary.

You can create both **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field settings for the same reference field.

### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Search** &gt; **AI Search Index** &gt; **Indexed Sources**.

2.  In the Field Settings &amp; Mapping related list, select **New**.

3.  On [the Field Setting form](../reference/field-setting-form-ais.md), enter the field values shown for your use-case.

    -   To index field values from referenced tables for use in search source filters, facet filters, and EVAM search result configurations, enter the following field values.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Attribute|dot\_walk\_fields|
        |Field|&lt;name of indexed source table reference field that you want to use to dot-walk to another table&gt;|
        |Value|&lt;comma-separated list of names for fields that you want to index from the referenced table&gt;|

    -   To index field values from referenced tables as searchable text, enter the following field values.

        |Field|Value|
        |-----|-----|
        |Attribute|searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields|
        |Field|&lt;name of indexed source table reference field that you want to use to dot-walk to another table&gt;|
        |Value|&lt;comma-separated list of names for fields that you want to index from the referenced table&gt;|

    **Note:** If the **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** attributes don't appear in the **Attribute** selection list, ensure that your **Field** selection is a reference field.

4.  Select **Submit**.

    The attribute and value appear in the Field Settings &amp; Mapping related list.


## List of AI Search indexed source field settings

You can adjust indexing behavior for source record fields in an AI Search indexed source by configuring field setting attributes and values.

For more information on creating field settings, see [Create a field setting for an AI Search indexed source](field-settings-ais.md#).

dot\_walk\_fields

</td><td>

Index reference and display values from fields on the selected reference field's source table for use in search source filters, facet filters, and EVAM search result configurations. AI Search automatically updates the indexed field values to reflect changes made to the referenced table's field values.

 For more information about search source filters, see [Search sources in AI Search](search-sources-ais.md). For details on facet filters, see [Create a facet in an AI Search application configuration](../task/create-facet-ais.md).

-   Field: Name of the reference field on your indexed source table. As an example, if your indexed source table contains a **company** reference field that references the Company \[core\_company\] table, and you want to index field values from that table's **name** and **city** fields, you'd set `company` as the field.
-   Type: string
-   Value: Comma-separated list of referenced table fields to index values from. As an example, if your indexed source table contains a **company** reference field that references the Company \[core\_company\] table, and you want to index field values from that table's **name** and **city** fields, you'd set `name,city` as the value.

**Note:** You can't search field values indexed with this field setting. To index field values from referenced tables for search, create a **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field setting. You can create both **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field settings for the same reference field.

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the change doesn't take effect until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

index\_calculated\_field

</td><td>

Option to enable indexing of searchable content from calculated field values. If your indexed source contains a calculated field, set this field setting to **true** for that field to correctly index its values. With a field setting value of **false** or no value, AI Search ignores values from the calculated field when indexing content.

-   Field: Name of a calculated field from the indexed source table. \(If you specify a non-calculated field, the system rejects the field setting submission and displays a warning message.\)
-   Type: true \| false
-   Supported values:
    -   **true**: Apply special handling to correctly index calculated field values from the selected field.
    -   **false**: Don't apply special handling when indexing field values from the selected field. Calculated field values aren't indexed.

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the change doesn't take effect until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

map\_to

</td><td>

Map the selected field from the indexed source table to an AI Search index field. When indexing records from the source table, AI Search populates the specified index field with the value of the selected source field. For example, the base system's Knowledge Table indexed source maps the **kb\_knowledge.short\_description** source field to the **title** index field. When AI Search indexes a record from the Knowledge \[kb\_knowledge\] table, it populates the indexed record's searchable title with the value from the source record's **short\_description** field.

-   Field: Name of a field from the indexed source table.
-   Type: string
-   Value: Name of the AI Search field that you want to map the selected field's display values to. For details on AI Search index fields, see [AI Search index fields](../reference/index-fields-list-ais.md).

**Note:** You can only define one **map\_to** field setting for an indexed source field. If you try to define multiple **map\_to** settings for the same field, the system displays an error message.

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the change doesn't take effect until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

no\_text\_index

</td><td>

Option to disable indexing of searchable content from the selected field on records from the indexed source.-   Field: Name of a field from the indexed source table.
-   Type: true \| false
-   Supported values:
    -   **true**: Disable searchable content indexing for the selected field. Search and filters can't match the field's value. AI Search doesn't generate an index event when the field is updated.
    -   **false**: Enable searchable content indexing for the selected field. Search and filters can match the field's value. AI Search generates an index event when the field is updated, adding the affected record to its indexing queue.
-   Default value: **false**

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the new value immediately affects index event generation for updates to that field, but it doesn't affect searches or filters for previously indexed records until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

 **Warning:** Don't set this option to **true** for the sys\_updated\_on field on the Task \[task\] table, tables that extend Task, or any other tables that you've configured retention policies for. The retention policies for these tables rely on indexing of sys\_updated\_on field values. For more information on retention policies, see [Indexed source retention policies and filter conditions](retention-policies-conditions-ais.md).

For Customer Service and Support guidelines on setting the **no\_text\_index** option for different field types, see [KB0859922](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0859922) on the Now Support site.

</td></tr><tr><td>

not\_searchable

</td><td>

Option to disable search matching for content indexed from the selected field.-   Field: Name of a field from the indexed source table.
-   Type: true \| false
-   Supported values:
    -   **true**: Disable search matching for content indexed from the selected field. Search can't match the field's value. Filters \(such as those for content security, source facet buckets, and facets\) can still match the field's value.
    -   **false**: Enable search matching for content indexed from the selected field. Search and filters can match the field's value.
-   Default value: **false**

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the change doesn't take effect until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields

</td><td>

Index reference and display values from fields on the selected reference field's source table as searchable text. AI Search doesn't automatically update the indexed field values to reflect changes made to the referenced table's field values. To update the indexed field values, you must reindex the indexed source. For details on this procedure, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

-   Field: Name of the reference field on your indexed source table. As an example, if your indexed source table contains a **company** reference field that references the Company \[core\_company\] table, and you want to index searchable text from that table's **name** and **city** fields, you'd set `company` as the field.
-   Type: string
-   Value: Comma-separated list of referenced table fields to index as searchable content. As an example, if your indexed source table contains a **company** reference field that references the Company \[core\_company\] table, and you want to index searchable text from that table's **name** and **city** fields, you'd set `name,city` as the value.

**Note:** You can't use field values indexed with this field setting in search source filters. To index field values from referenced tables for use in search source filters, create a **dot\_walk\_fields** field setting. You can create both **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field settings for the same reference field.

 If you change the value of this setting for an indexed source's field, the change doesn't take effect until you reindex content from the indexed source. For reindexing steps, see [Perform a full table index or reindex for a single AI Search indexed source](../task/index-single-source-ais.md).

</table>**Note:** Field settings are records on the AI Search Configuration Attribute \[ais\_configuration\_attribute\] table that have Column as their **Applies To** field value. Records on this table that have Table as their **Applies To** field value are [Indexed source attributes for AI Search](indexed-source-attributes-ais.md#).

This example shows how the base system's Catalog Item Table indexed source maps **short\_description** field values from the Catalog Item \[sc\_cat\_item\] table to the AI Search index's **text** field for indexed records.

## Security for searchable referenced table field values in AI Search

When a user searches referenced table field values that you have indexed for search with the **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field setting, only field values that the user can view appear in the search results. The system uses a field value's role-based access control list rules \(ACLs\) to determine whether the search user can view that field value.

Searchable referenced table field values that have condition-based or script-based ACLs or user criteria don't appear in search results.

For searchable field values indexed through multiple dot-walk reference levels, the system only considers role-based ACLs on the final field value. As an example, if you index `company.contact.name` referenced table field values for search, user access to **name** field values isn't affected by role-based ACLs on **contact** field values.

To bypass all ACLs and allow users to search for all searchable referenced table field values, you can set the **glide.ais.query.allow\_indexlookup\_for\_dotwalk** system property to true. This bypasses ACL evaluation for field values indexed via the **dot\_walk\_fields** and **searchable\_dot\_walk\_fields** field settings.

For more details on ACL types and configuration, see [Access control list rules](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=access-control-rules&version=yokohama&pubname=yokohama-platform-security&ft:locale=en-US).
